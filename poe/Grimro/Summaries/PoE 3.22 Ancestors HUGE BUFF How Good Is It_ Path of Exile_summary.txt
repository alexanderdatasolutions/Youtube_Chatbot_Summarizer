Grim, in his latest video, discusses the new huge patch for Trial of the Ancestors which overhauls the rewards of the League mechanic. The loot changes include better scaling at higher rankings, better chances for rewards previously exclusive to the final round to appear in all rounds, and an increased chance for valuable rewards and higher stack sizes, such as Divine Orbs, Exalted Orbs, Scarabs, etc. The patch also allows Divination cards to come in varying stack sizes. There's a new final round drop, giving the player 3-5 clan-specific tattoos. Other changes include an improved amount of favor acquired from each of the rounds. Grim spent 8 hours testing the new mechanic and prepared a loot report for his viewers. The text describes a progression in a game after a certain update or patch. It now offers the ability to stack multiple units and provides increased ease to ascend into higher ranks. This has significantly improved the speaker's ability to defeat enemies and climb up the rankings. The speaker's ranking rose from 1,000 to 1,400 and anticipates reaching up to 2,000 without major setbacks. There has also been an increase in the amounts of rewards (named as Regal Orbs), the cap of which appears to have increased from three to five to nine. The speaker performed a test to measure progress and potential gain, playing for a day and moving from rank 1,000 to 1,400. The test resulted in a significant amount of loot, which is categorized into two sets (juicy tab and bubblegum tab). The speaker completed 32 tournaments (approx. 220 rounds) in 8.13 hours to obtain this loot. This was more challenging due to the higher rank and resulted in numerous failures, but the gains made were perceived to be significant. The value and time required to earn the loot are unknown and would be reviewed in a forthcoming spreadsheet analysis. The information is regarding the changing market prices of tattoo items, "omens," and "uniques" in a game. Prices have significantly dropped; for example, the Plus One Power Charge tattoo's price has fallen from 12 Divines to four Divines, and the Berserker tattoo from three Divines to 190C. Likewise, the prices for the cheaper tattoos remain steady. The drop in price is also noticed in omens and uniques; Mata's Teaching, previously priced at three div, is now 285C, while Rakiata's Dance is now priced at 190. The decrease in prices is attributed to a lack of in-game demand because no build guides currently require these items for players to succeed. As demand increases, prices may rise. However, it is suspected the current prices are indicative of their actual value.
 The text discusses the non-exclusive rewards from the game “Ancestors, 1,000 to 1,400 Elo." The author received nine Divines, two Annulments, and 17 Exalted Orbs, more of these rewards than the author had received before. With the new patch, these forms of rewards have become more common. The author highlighted that they often received three to five T1 currencies and once got five Divines. Exalted Orbs were received more frequently, in full stacks, and Annulment Orbs were gotten most times, in singles. The author had a preference for Divines over Exalts and Annulments. Additionally, the author received a sacred orb, which is rarer than the three other currencies. 

The author also observed a significant increase in "bubblegum currency" and found a lot of good things there, mentioning getting items like awaken sextants, chaos orbs, and lower tier currencies like alx fusings with larger stack sizes. The author pointed out receiving more frequent rewards and higher stack sizes of eight to 15 for chaos orbs and sextants, and some 20 for lower tier currencies. Additionally, the author received two forbidden terms and several nice divination. From the text, the speaker seems to discuss a game that involves collectible items like Zeron's reward, monochrome, and empower. The speaker is content with a haul worth approximately 3,200 chaos. The conversation then shifts to League Mechanic exclusive rewards, honor tattoos, and how the yield has changed after a significant price drop of the best tattoos. 

The speaker notes that fewer honor tattoos were obtained this time as they chose omens and some uniques. The ratio of good to bad honor tattoos has also shifted, with more of the 'good' ones being obtained. The speaker theorizes, based on their game-playing experience, that the rarity of different tattoos is dependent on the player's ranking in the game. 

Additionally, the speaker discusses collecting the Warrior's Tale unique, two Loyalty tattoos, and one Makanga tattoo. The Makanga tattoos are deemed rare, as they were not frequently obtained during the game. Lastly, they received only one special unique item, which is also considered rare based on their personal testing. The speaker is discussing a recent endeavor where they gathered items, particularly tattoos, from a game. The strategy involved keeping certain characters alive till the end in hopes of obtaining rare tattoos like Mekonga. The speaker didn't get many of the mentioned tattoos, with only one projectile speed tattoo, one Warcry cooldown, and two Explody obtained. They also managed to secure five different Omens, including a Connections, two Jewelers, and two Blanching ones. Lesser quality tattoos were not pursued as much, due to the availability of better rewards. The speaker explains that if weak tattoos were collected, it was likely due to aiming for favor rewards. The speaker also mentions that the more significant tattoos, namely Honoured, Loyalty, and Makanga, were valued at roughly 2000 chaos, even after a significant price drop. Notable items include a few poor-quality Uniques. They promise to share their strategic approach in an upcoming video. The text discusses an experiment testing the potential wealth gain in a tattoo purchase-investment system, presumably within a video game. The test resulted in earning an approximated four Divines per hour. If the value of the tattoos hadn't decreased, that estimate might've been much higher, possibly reaching around 60 per hour. The author references upcoming updates to the game that may enable players to earn even more currency and mentions the potential for hugely successful outcomes, like winning a pair of Fiend cards. The author also notes reports of significant loot drops, like major bloods and headhunters, obtained by other players after the patch, leading to a potential for luck-based gains. However, these significant loot drops are not included in the calculated results. Games mentioned are Sanctum, Legion, and Delirium, which are considered more lucrative for the time being. The text is discussing the mechanics and potential rewards of certain aspects of a game (possibly Path of Exile). 

- The speaker draws a parallel between divination cards, the "trial of the ancestors" and "ritual" mechanics, and the proverb "where there's smoke, there's fire", indicating the likelihood of obtaining good rewards with persistence. 
- A highlight is that there's a small but real chance to obtain rarity; making it possible to get "insanely lucky" and find extraordinary items like "Apothecary", "Mirror of Calandra" and "Hinokora's Lock", although the latter is very scarce (only 18 available) and valuable (worth 20 divines).
- The speaker points out the difference between "ritual" and "trial of the ancestors" mechanics, emphasizing that the latter offers a better baseline of loot which includes divination cards, exalts, and nulls, some valued at a few divines, along with unique items and other lesser grade items.
- There's a suggestion that "trial of the ancestors" offers a higher chance to drop the "Mirror of Calandra" compared to other game's mechanics; however, nobody has confirmed obtaining the "Hinokora's Lock" yet.
- Despite the potential for extraordinary findings, there are also opportunities to obtain more common items such as lower grade tattoos, scarabs, the bubblegum currency, and others that contribute considerable rewards. The text discuses the mechanic in Hinokora's Lock, highlighting its unstable nature but also acknowledging it's improved with buffed rewards. The key question is whether the Trial of the Ancestors is worth farming. The answer depends on whether the player enjoys the mechanic and if they're willing to gamble their time. Despite not being as lucrative as other farming strategies like Legion, Delirium, Magic Find, and Expedition, decent currency can be made, especially if the player gets lucky. There's minimal expense in engaging with the Trial of the Ancestors, but the value of time must be considered. The text mentions plans for a future strategy video detailing how the author achieved rank 1400 and anticipates reaching rank 2000.
