Karim in his video discusses about the resurrection of the 'juicing' strategy for solo players in Path of Exile (PoE) patch 3.22. 'Juicing' refers to maximizing a map with as much increased item quantity, pack size, and rarity as possible, multiplying everything with the Atlas passive tree and Scarabs. It was a common strategy in the endgame but was overshadowed by other strategies such as farming Crimson Temple for Apothecaries and using Delirium mobs to get Delirium rewards. However, these strategies have high maintenance costs and demand high-level characters, limiting their usage. Reasons behind 'juicing' becoming less prominent include the introduction of eldritch alters and buffs to all Alcan-Go league mechanics like Legion, Expedition, and Blight. These changes incentivized speed farming strategies which became incredibly profitable. Despite the changes, with patch 3.22, the 'juicing' strategy is expected to experience a resurgence due to its favorable gaming style.
 1. Juicing has been nerfed considerably, reducing its efficacy.
2. 'Beyond' has been revamped to reduce the frequency of Beyond bosses appearing; when they do appear, they are more difficult but drop less loot. No more Beyond monsters or portals appear after the boss spawns.
3. The revised Beyond mechanic leads to potential losses of up to 30-40% of mobs, resulting in reduced potential profit.
4. Due to these changes, Beyond has become predominantly an alchemy mechanic.
5. Significant modifications were made to loot systems and multipliers either in Calandra or Sanctum League, negatively affecting magic finding and group play in the end game.
6. Some mechanics, such as the extra currency items from nemesis monsters, were removed from the game.
7. Changes to the economy included a shift in the primary currency from exalted orbs to divine orbs, altering the value of farming divination cards. The text discusses changes in the game Path of Exile, focusing on currency farming strategies and upcoming updates in version 3.22. It suggests a shift in dynamic from using exalted orbs to divine orbs in-game currency. The popular technique known as 'juicing' could potentially fine resurgence with these changes. 

An important update is the reintroduction of the Beyond feature, particularly a mechanic called the Endless Tide Keystone. This mechanic prevents spawn of unique bosses, thereby facilitating continuous access to Beyond. This is crucial as Beyond now drops a new form of currency called Tainted Currency, which scales with the amount generated with increased item quantity and the number of monsters spawned. This makes it a potential good source of in-game currency and aligns with the juicing play style. Types of Tainted Currency include Tinted Fusing, Tinted Chromatics, and Divine Teardrops, offering a significant addition to the loot table for juicing. 

The text suggests there may be some downsides, like the absence of unique monsters from the Beyond feature, but overall presents the reintroduction of Beyond as a major advantage. Other unspecified Beyond features are also mentioned. The text describes the beneficial aspects of "Beyond," which includes improvements and added benefits in a game (not named). These benefits include an increased potential due to added features and a 30% increase for maps, uniques, currency, and divination cards. Though monsters are now able to drop useful in-game items, this is not enough for consistent farming. The text suggests using the Fortunate Divination card, a new addition in version 3.22 as a possible solution. This new card requires 12 divination cards and gives two divine orbs. The card drops on any map tagged with Sun, Natural Area. It's similar to the previously used Saint’s Treasure Divination card in terms of rarity. Beach Map is mentioned as an optimal location. The text is discussing various maps in a game (possibly Path of Exile) and their association with Divination cards. The Beach map is quick to navigate and not too full of monsters. Burial Chambers map drops the Divination card for Divine Orbs and the Headhunter Divination card, making it a particularly beneficial map for items. Burial Chambers also has a high natural mob density which makes it good for "juicing". Canyon map is a traditionally well-loved map due to its layout and also drops Divination card. 

Jungle Valley map is potentially the most impactful as it not only drops Divination card, but also another card called 'the scout' which rewards Exalted Orbs - both of these are top tier in-game currencies. Jungle Valley has a unique mechanic with Eldritch altars; where normally you don't get global modifiers on altars, you do on Jungle Valley because the boss altars are blocked. Jungle Valley is a popular and successful location for magic finding maps due to a divination card found there. The map also works well for gaming aspects like Breach, Legion, and others. Dunes is another location where this divination card can be located, it is specifically known best for Breach and Legion play. Additional mechanics can be applied to Dune strategies to collect more divination cards. The use of divination card scarabs on maps in Dunes can further boost the divination card gain by 50% or more. The strategy has the potential to significantly change gameplay and encourages players to push their strategies further. Tropical Island also drops the scout, which was previously the best map for Delirium mirrors if Simulacrum splinter farming was involved. Overall, the text suggests ways to maximize in-game gains using divination cards and scarabs in different maps. Beyond synergizes well with Delirium. Honorary legends include Shore and Estuary, but they are not as good as others like Dunes. Mesa is a great speed farming map where one or two divination cards can be found occasionally which would significantly impact gameplay. There is a large number of monsters on our maps, and they have been enhanced due to Endless Tide. The Fortunate, a consistent and accessible element to farm, is present on all regular maps. This allows players to use known tactics to increase their profitability, or invent entirely new strategies. There are potentially new strategies on the horizon for 3.22, and aspects like Tormented Spirits could be worth experimenting with in the future.
