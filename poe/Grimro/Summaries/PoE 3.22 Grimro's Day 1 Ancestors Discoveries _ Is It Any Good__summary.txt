The text is from a video by Grim, where he explains his findings from his first day playing Trial of the Ancestors. In order to participate in the game, players need silver coins which are quite common in maps and campaigns. To start, players need to use a silver coin which opens a portal to the Halls of the Dead. Afterwards, they interact with the Well of Passing and head to the Eye of Destiny. The game involves engaging in combat. The choice of an opponent determines the rewards, which scale with the number of tournaments completed. Completing tournaments also improves a player's ranking, which impacts the level of opponents faced. The rewards can include currency, div cards, uniques, rares, and tattoos. Grim notes that an increase in currency earned was a significant scaling factor from his perspective. Initially, he earned about 2-3C per round, but this amount increased to 4-5C or even 6C per round over time.
 The text is about a strategic game where the player goes against different opponents. There are ten types of opponents, each with their unique fighting themes and units. The player scores points by overcoming these opponents, but the focus should be on rewards rather than points. The gameplay involves deciding what reward to aim for and preparing for the round. Once in the game, players need to consider the available units for placement on their board.

Four positions can be equipped: defender, escort, attacker, and flanker. The flanker position, where a unit will bypass enemy NPCs to attack the enemy's base, is deemed the most valuable. The player can defend their base and attack enemy units, but it is less effective for a player to destroy the enemy's base due to certain penalties. Therefore, the suggested strategy is to outfit the flanker positions with the best units available. The text describes a strategic approach to placing melee units in a game. The speaker often begins by deploying units like the "Tuatara" due to its quick speed and moderate strength attributes in a flanking position, tasked with destroying the enemy's base. Other units in this role include the "warrior," the "Hidecross Horn," and the "Fieldmaster." 

Next, "attacker" and "escort" positions are filled. The attackers, meant for damaging enemies or melee attacks, are positioned in front lines with tanks. In comparison, the escort position mostly includes caster units who provide support and are tied to the players' movements. They primarily focus on assisting the player, with crowd control abilities like throwing cold spells from a distance.

Lastly, the "defender" position consists of units that safeguard the player's base from enemy attacks. These units sit in the base and engage when it's under threat. The text is an explanation of the game mechanics and strategic elements of playing "Trial of the Ancestors". The overall goal of the game is to kill all enemy units, and then destroy the enemy base, represented by totems. Killing an enemy unit will remove it from the current round, but units have the ability to respawn at the base totem. If a team’s base totem is destroyed, their units no longer respawn in the current round. The destruction process does not involve using character skills or abilities, but instead requires channeling energy onto the totem by clicking on it. 

The player's character is significantly stronger than their team units, being capable of killing an entire enemy wave by themselves. Thus, it's strategic for the player to engage in combat personally while their team channels energy onto the enemy totems. The implication is to prioritize positioning to ensure the successful execution of this strategy. Additionally, the strategy can include defending the player's own base to prevent enemies from easily attacking it. The text appears to be discussing strategy in a game scenario involving units, enemy totems, and stuns. Here are the key points:

1. The recommended strategy is to position all units in the flank, prioritize attacking, then escorts, and lastly, defense.
2. There's a difficulty in attacking as the enemy can stun a player for a significant time by any hit, even a minor one, resulting in potentially serious consequences.
3. Enemies can also attack the player's totems, but the same stunning rule applies, presenting an opportunity for defense.
4. The best approach is to eliminate all enemy units, protect the base, and let the units attack the enemy's totems.
5. The initial totems knocked out are deemed most important as they can shift the battle advantage by reducing enemy presence.
6. The overall endgame is to overwhelm and crush the enemy.
7. The strategy for the Trial of the Ancestors mechanic essentially involves appropriate unit positioning, base defense, and attack on enemy units.
8. Some discussion about strengthening the player's team is intended to follow. The text is about an ongoing multiplayer tournament game where players progress through fighting enemies, acquiring new units, and upgrading those units. After beat each round of the tournament, players face stronger enemies and collect fresh sets of rewards. As they move through, the enemies continue to get stronger, with the finals having fully elite enemy teams. 

Players can match the enemy's strength by spending 'favor' with different clans to acquire or upgrade their units. After every round, whether they win or lose, players get 250 coins and can purchase one unit from Nivali for 250 coins. A unit, once purchased, can be placed on the field in specific positions. 

If a player has 'favor' points ranging from 500 to 1,000, they can use these points to buy more units from corresponding icons (clans) on the mini-map. The key strategy is to prioritize buying as many units as possible until the player has a full team. 

Having more units enables the player's team to channel onto the enemy's totems faster and increase their chaos and currency per hour. The goal is to take out all enemies and fully maximize the player's teams. The text appears to describe a strategy for a game involving tournaments, units and currency elements. The player can increase the amount of tournaments they can win per hour. They purchased a unit for 600 units of in-game currency, called "juice". In the next round, they need to strategically place new units, such as a caster, a wall caller, and attackers. 

The game involves a profitable mechanic where the player can earn around 2 to 5C value per win by beating a round. However, this varies depending on the item level or enemy level. At level 79, the player may take up to 10 minutes to beat a round. This may not result in a lot of currency per hour. 

The understanding of units and assigning them is still rudimentary, meaning there is potential for efficiency and profitability to increase as players better understand the game mechanics. Lastly, "tattoos" are mentions as a valuable reward in the game, but many players have not fully grasped their significance. The text discusses a league mechanic featuring getting "tattoos" as rewards for completion of specific events in an unidentified game. The speaker mentions that these tattoos are not in high demand for exchange of game currency. The speaker has not received any messages to buy any of their tattoos. Most quality tattoos are received as "honored tattoos" when a tournament is won. Tournaments usually require roughly 7-8 completed matches for a win. After a win, another player, Hinokoro, offers a choice between an honored tattoo and an "omen" as an extra reward. In addition, the speaker doesn't consider silver coins (potentially the game's currency) as expensive. The speaker suggests that efficient round completion can lead to good in-game currency per hour, considering the possible future increase in tattoo prices. Lastly, some gameplay advice is provided - players should defend their base and respond promptly when an "X" appears on any of their totems. The main strategy is to stun enemies and kill them without losing any of your own units. The speaker likes to hang around the enemy's base and attack their totem when possible, retreating when enemies approach. The goal is to weaken the enemy's totems and speed up your own clearing process. If possible, try to focus on more powerful enemies and totems. The worst scenario is getting stunned by the enemy. There's a potential for more advanced tactics as playtime increases. Also, there's mention of a forthcoming video about tattoos, which are part of the customization and enhancement process in the game; the speaker uses a lot of them to improve his gameplay. The speaker has multiple tattoos and expresses a desire to have more. However, they find it irritating to purchase them due to their low cost, which implies a lack of seller response. The speaker discusses the game or challenge 'Trial of the Ancestors', and suggests this discussion provides additional information about it. They invite feedback, queries, or suggestions via comments, which they promise to read, respond to, and possibly include in a future video. The speaker hopes the audience enjoyed the content and signs off optimistically.
