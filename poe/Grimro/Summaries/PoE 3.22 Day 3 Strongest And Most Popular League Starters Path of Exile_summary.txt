The text discusses league styles, and the most played skills within them. The most played league starter is surprisingly Lightning Arrow Artillery Ballista, despite predictions otherwise due to the nerf of Vengeance Cascade. Accounting for 12% of total play, many users are starting to switch from Lightning Arrow to other endgame builds. High-level players are also using the Lightning Arrow, demonstrating its strength and popularity in the endgame. Many players use the returning projectile support in their Lightning Arrow build, replacing Vengeance Cascade. Another popular build mentioned is Hexblast Mines although not as highly played as Lightning Arrow. The text suggests that this round of play might be when Hexblast Mines become more prominent. It's suggested that many players have found success with Hexblast Mines despite it not being a speed mapping build. The key information from the text revolves around different game elements, particularly builds, popular among players. 

1. Bone Zone: One of the most played builds, popular particularly for melee strikes. It has a positive reputation among gamers.

2. Righteous Fire: It is a favorite for many due to its tankiness, although it's not the fastest. A guide by Pox has contributed significantly to its popularity.

3. Spark: Noted for being a great league starter, but not as many people play it. Despite this, the build displays high levels, indicating that it's either very fast, very tanky, or both. It also features some intriguing item tech.

4. Explosive Arrow: Another tried and true build notable for its effectiveness in the Trial of the Ancestors game.

5. Summon Raging Spirits: This build also surfaced in the text, with two variants highlighted - Poison, which most players engage with, and the Minion Instability version. Overall, it's considered a decent choice. 

The discussion emphasizes that these builds possess unique capabilities that make them well-suited to certain types of game play, such as bossing, sanctum running or league starting.
 The text discusses different builds in a game, highlighting their performance, popularity, and strengths. It refers to two variants of Exsanguinate: the self-cast Exsanguinate build and the Exsanguinate Trapper with Seismic Trap. The self-cast Exsanguinate build is gaining popularity and seeing success. Other builds discussed include Toxic Rain, which is popular and effective in heist and mapping; Vortex (Cold Knot) which is a strong and established build; and Fire Trap, which although not the most popular, still sees some play. Lastly, it mentions Corrupting Fever, a build that appears to be declining in popularity in favour of alternatives like Lightning Arrow. The text suggests further analysis is to be undertaken on these builds. The text provides an evaluation of two builds for mapping in a game, "Corrupting Fever" and "Lightning Arrow". The speaker indicates a preference for Lightning Arrow, claiming it performs better than Corrupting Fever. They note that Lightning Arrow is a better choice if you're planning to transition into an end game blaster. 

They provide details about the popularity of different builds. According to the statistics from Peewee Ninja, for game levels 82 to 100, Lightning Arrow is the most popular build, followed by Corrupting Fever. In the specifics of Lightning Arrow's setting, certain features are highlighted such as being able to use the Berserk variant, its clear speed, damage capabilities, and single-target performance. It is emphasized that the setup includes using an early bow, going for crit, and getting a ton of flat damage from a chest piece high res Aya. In addition, the Berserk combo of calm spirit and vol's vision are suggested components for this build.

The text concludes by suggesting that Lightning Arrow is a powerful choice for league starters due to its fast farming speed and potential for currency generation. It's also noted that totems could be helpful with the league mechanic. The text discusses three main game builds: 

1. Artillery Ballistas: This is described as a ‘phenomenal build’ and is recommended for those who want to adopt a more strategic approach in the game. The player needs to set up their own totems and destroy the enemies' totems while attacking them simultaneously with artillery ballistas.
 
2. Hexblast Mines – Korean Kalm's Heart Wrathpith Globe version: This build is praised for packing a punch in terms of single target and specialising in mechanics like Sanctum and bossing. The build may involve the use of unique jewels which could be challenging to acquire. Despite this, it is described as very good and a lot of players have achieved high levels with it. Its downside is its slow speed in mapping.

3. Exsanguinate and its variants: The text gives little detail on these, implying they are popular and already well known. 

The text also mentions the builds EA (Elemental Attack) and Poison SRS (Summon Raging Spirit), stating that they haven't changed significantly, but lacks detail on their specific mechanics. The text provides information about certain player builds in a game. A specific build that stands out is the Poison Exsanguinate build on Pathfinder using Dendrobate. This build is noted to potentially be faster and tankier than other builds, but could also be favored by more skilled or experienced players. Generally, players at a higher level using these builds indicates the high caliber of the build. The Exsanguinate self-cast variant seems to be very effective. Most players who use this build typically incorporate one to two Cold Iron points and possibly make use of more shield charge action and defense strategies. Other popular builds include Toxic Rain, Cold Dot, Fire Trap, and Corrupting Fever, which are generally consistent in their design. An observed change in the Corrupting Fever build is the use of a certain body armor that provides life regeneration and chaos resistance, beneficial for a build that uses life as a resource. This could be a notable change in this build's strategies. The text discusses a body armor that mitigates chaos damage in multiple ways, benefiting users by providing chaos resistance. This armor has been increasingly used, notably for league starters. Games using this armor include Corrupting Fever and Bone Shatter, which both leverage the armor's life regen function. It has been noted that the Cold Iron Point variant of Corrupting Fever is becoming popular, but the Poet’s Pen variant remains more dominant. 

However, the use of Corrupting Fever has somewhat diminished due to the rise of Lightning Arrow, which players see as a better mapper. The author finds the meta of the league to be quite diverse with a variety of builds. However, there were discrepancies between predictions to the actual results in gaming. The author ends by suggesting players looking for a change to refer to their mentioned list and encourages them to explore further options.
