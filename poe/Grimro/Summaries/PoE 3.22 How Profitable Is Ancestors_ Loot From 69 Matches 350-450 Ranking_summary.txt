The speaker is discussing the profitability and potential currency to be earned in a new league mechanic. They are currently ranked 456, which is a fairly high ranking. The rankings can go as high as 700 but according to a general consensus, the rewards do not seem to increase after reaching around 300 ranking. The increase in ranking results in an increase in difficulty, but not necessarily reward. The rewards, such as the currency stack size and the variety of accessible tattoos, seem to remain consistent despite the rise in difficulty. With the current 1.0 patch, it is not easy to lower one's ranking which could result in a difficult situation with little perceived reward.
 The speaker talks about their heavily equipped Omniscience Tornado Shot character, detailing the character's current gear, including Eldritch gear, a Tornado Shot Helmet Enchant, an Omniscience, Corrupted gear, a powerful bow and quiver, Lethal Pride, Massive Threat of Hope, and Inspired Loneliness with the Double Cluster. However, the character lacks a better helmet, belt, a Mage Blood, a Watcher's Eye and double Forbidden Flesh Flame. The character was used to farm the lead mechanic for two hours 32 minutes and 31 seconds, attempting to maximize currency earnings. The player utilized the strategy of balancing the efficiency of runs and picking up valuable rewards, and gained a substantial number of tattoos. A total of 10 full matches were completed in the specified timespan, corresponding to about 69 rounds. The person spent 2.5 hours completing 69 rounds and 10 matches of an unspecified game, which equated to roughly 2.17 minutes per round. The spoils included a unique belt, nine honored tattoos, and 134 "C" of bubblegum/garbage currency that he/she describes as, in reality, being worth about 90 C. They also obtained an animate weapon of level 21, no divines but an annul and an exalt. They did not find high stack sizes of divines and are not aware of anyone else who has either. The main questions they are examining are the true worth of the rewards and whether the time spent was worth it. The speaker purchased two rare loyalty tattoos of Ahuana and Rakiata as well as nine honored tattoos from completing matches. Although these are considered of some value, they are not particularly high-value items. After pricing the tattoos on Peewee Ninja, the speaker made a total of 147C from selling them. Combining this with an earlier bubblegum stack sale, the speaker made a total of 281C. Based on the current market value of divines at 145 each, the speaker made about 1.93 divines, or roughly three-quarters of a divine per hour spent over 2.5 hours. However, the speaker stresses that they believe their luck was very poor, as they did not receive any high value items such as good Omens, Uniques, high-value tattoos, or Divines. The text describes the value of various tattoos in a game. The Ramiko Sniper tattoo commonly sells for 10 C, and if a player has multiples of this tattoo, they can be sold all at once. However, rare honored tattoos are ideally what players aim for since they bring in a lot of money, although these are extremely hard to come by. The text also mentions other tattoo values, with some going up to 16 C and others worth around 5 C, suggesting a fluctuating tattoo-market. Another notable tattoo type mentioned is the Makanga tattoo, however, the speaker was unable to obtain any. Lastly, the speaker suggests there was a point of low supply, which could potentially increase the worth of particular tattoos. Makanga tattoos are very rare variants of tribal tattoos that can appear in fighting rounds. Despite considerable gameplay, the individual speaking has not found any of these tattoos. Notably, the Skillsfire Additional Projectile Makanga tattoo is quite valuable. Other rare tattoos, like the Incredibly Rare Honor tattoos, can also hold significant value, although general tattoos do not. The tattoo of the warmonger, another rare tattoo, holds a certain level of interest. High-efficiency farming for an estimated two and a half hours did not yield the acquisition of any of these rare tattoos. The individual plans to continue this process, possibly editing their approach to improve results. In order to maximize currency and potential rewards, users should follow some key steps. The first one is to pick up the favor if they're having difficulty and want a headstart against enemies particularly those with a lot of favor. For maximizing currency, a strong build is essential. Furthermore, it is suggested to scout all the tattoos. Also, certain members must be kept alive, especially the plus one projectile character from the Ramako Tribe, who can spawn the rare Makanga tattoo. Avoid fighting the Ramako tribe for a better chance at gaining a valuable Makanga tattoo. The Ramako tribe also spawns the projectile speed tattoo, which is worth 10C and worth pursuing. Another strategy is to compete in a way that does not result in the tournament participants being knocked out. Once a competitor has lost one match, an icon appears next to their name, and if they lose another battle, they are out of the tournament. Keeping participants in the tournament ensures more rewards to choose from. The text suggests that a strategy in game matches involves being conservative in battling participants who have not lost yet. This approach can potentially bring more rewards, including valuable tattoos. However, over-battling and knocking out everyone can lead to fewer rewards. On the downside, the game appears to be restrictive in terms of influencing reward outcomes beyond selecting the right match. The effectiveness of this strategy is contingent on keeping players with valuable tattoos in the game and maximizing enemy choices. 

The discussion also addresses the development of the gaming mechanic and criticizes it for not offering enough liquid currency compared to other farming mechanics like Sanctum, or Legion. It's also easier to earn currency and salable goods other than the game mechanic. Any value derived from this mechanic, unless altered or improved, would come from the tattoos, which are currently inexpensive. The only way to raise their value would be if players become more interested in purchasing these tattoos for their gaming build. The text discusses a prediction about the rising demand and increasing prices of tattoos related to a certain game mechanic. This is due to the mechanic currently being perceived as not profitable, leading to a decline in the supply of tattoos. As the supply reduces, prices are expected to surge significantly as players look to min-max their builds and experiment more. The speaker foresees greater profitability if players start paying higher prices for these tattoos, despite them currently being unprofitable. The speaker plans to continue experimenting with the mechanic and promises to share findings on how to optimize it in a future video. Their goal is to find a method that can complete the mechanic in an average of two minutes. The speaker hopes this information is beneficial and will share more updates in the future.
