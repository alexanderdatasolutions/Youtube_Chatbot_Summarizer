The text shares insights on handling the Trial of the Ancestors mechanic, including optimal units and strategies. The author emphasizes that the gameplay's efficiency is more about positioning and choice of units rather than the character's prowess. Risks and strategies can change depending on whether the player uses a ranged or a close-contact character. The game also has dedicated characters that exploit the system, side-stepping some strategies. Understanding unit positioning on the game board is crucial, with the attack being an essential unit as it attacks and defends. The attacker pushes forward into the enemy's base and attacks totems when there are no enemies, but can also defend when enemies approach your base. The text is a guide on strategic positioning in a game involving totems, attackers, flanters, and escort units. 

- Attackers will only move forward or around the flank or escort positions. They don't go to the back of the base. If the player is in the enemy's base rear, they don't need to worry about the enemy's attackers. Attackers don't help if the enemy is at the player's base rear. The player should put the strongest units on the frontline in attack position.

- Flanter position is crucial. Flanters ignore everything except enemy totems. They go directly for the enemy's base and continue to try to channel totems, even if they're going to die. Better flanters help in killing the enemy faster. Getting the best flanters from shops improves the player's clear speed and overall success rate. However, flanters won't help in defense.

- The Escort position units always try to follow the player unconditionally. If they are outside a certain imaginary radius around the player, they will try to get inside it. If the player repositions to the enemy's base rear, escort units will follow. The text discusses strategic roles in a game, including escorting and defending roles. Escort units are powerful and flexible, despite their weakness these units adapt to situations and imitate player actions. They accompany you during the game and attempt to perform helpful actions based on the context. However, they aren't effective when left idle; they perform better when engaged in activities such as channeling on totems. On the other hand, Defenders are static, remaining in the base unless an enemy attacks. These Defender units are deemed the weakest due to their defensive nature and lack of initiative, they cannot contribute to a winning strategy but rather prevent losses. A crucial tip shared is that the enemy's commander will move into your base bringing their escorts who will engage with your units or start working on your totems. The text underlines several strategies and factors to consider in a game. 
1) The enemy units are always stronger and are worth more of the currency used to purchase units in the game. Engaging them directly will usually result in defeat.
2) The enemy has specific advantages that players do not. For example, when players or their units are hit by a breath of air while channeling or trying to destroy a totem, they will be stunned. However, enemy units are only briefly interrupted by attacks and will not be stunned.
3) The game is designed to give the enemy advantages, making it inherently unfair.
4) To win, take advantage of being a human playing against a computer by developing and implementing strategies.
5) Team building is essential for success in the game. The first key position is the flanker role, which should be filled by the fastest units available for quick victories. The text offers the Tuatara and the Kuni Kunis as good examples, along with two decent flankers, the Warriors.
6) It's important to utilize any units that have a specialized role, with the Tidecaller being a specialized defender as an example. These units should be used in the positions they excel at. The text offers strategic advice for a competitive game, suggesting the placement of units ("attackers" or "escorts") impacts the outcome of a match. The use of "attackers" is advocated for a more conservative, defensive approach to ensure minimal losses. Conversely, the use of "escorts" can lead to quick victories by overwhelming the opponent. The player's decision depends on their goal within the game (guaranteed safety versus faster victory).

During gameplay, it's advised to target the enemy's defenders first, and assist any unit attempting to "channel on a totem". Once the enemy's totems are under control, the game is essentially won, to the point where the player can be absent ("go AFK") without losing. A key component of the strategy appears to be protecting allied units when they are channeling and dodging enemy attacks. The goal is to bring down enemy totems as quickly as possible. The passage discusses a strategy for the base race in a game: 

- The base race strategy works because it exploits the game mechanics where enemy attackers push forward, leaving the enemy base unprotected.
- It involves positioning the player's units in the enemy's base back, keeping them safe from enemy attackers and not distracting them.
- Enemy flankers and unique monsters will mostly go and attack the player's base unconditionally, taking away all their escorts. This strategy leaves only the enemy defenders to protect their base.
- The player should focus on crowd controlling, killing or distracting enemy defenders. Meanwhile, the player's escorts and flankers can focus on destroying enemy's totems to win the game quickly.
- A potential drawback of this strategy is the risk of the player's unit death during execution. If player's units die, escorts will retreat to player’s base, and the player might get into a defensive position that can lead to losing a lot of totems.
- Also, the base race strategy may be harder to execute against certain compositions of enemy units. This tactic is not suitable for every game due to variables such as player's unit death or challenging enemy unit compositions. The player is up against a stronger enemy team in a game. The enemy team has two units that are powerful at dealing with the player's totems and also have proximity shields, making a base race a risky strategy. Instead, the player plans to use her/his placement for tactical advantage. With a ranged character, positioning is key. They intend to move downfield to a position that allows for both defense and offense. This placement lets them protect their base and also attack their enemy's base through ranged attacks. The location threatens a specific enemy totem, allowing the side troops to advance. The player's position also draws enemy units towards the lower area, which allows the flankers and attackers from their side stationed high up to take out enemy totems. Depending on the game's progress, the player can retreat or continue advancing to potentially trigger a base sprint in the enemy’s area. The smarts of this layered strategy would make up for their team's comparative weakness. They keep the approach flexible according to real-time on-field threats, respond to imminent danger, and allow supplementary troops to take over when needed. The speaker, likely in a video game context, identifies the enemy as stronger, but plans to let them take action first before defending or retaliating. The speaker considers moving into an offensive position, if things became unfavorable, they would retreat to their base. The speaker notes that this tactic is a quick way to win games. The speaker emphasizes that the type of units players choose is very crucial because a strong defensive team can prevent immediate losses upon death, while a good offensive team can kill opponents faster for a quicker clear speed. The speaker advises buying units at the end of each round and to use up all accumulated favor. The speaker has created a spreadsheet highlighting the best and worst units to help guide players' decisions. The text describes a ranking system for in-game units. The rankings are from bad to insane. Bad units are not worth the favor costs that they come with and ought to be sold to buy a different unit in the long run, but should still be kept in the early rounds of the game for having a physical presence on the board. Decent and good units can be picked up if the player has enough favor, but there may be better alternatives. They should not be farmed intensely. The insane units, however, are highly desirable and can define a team. They're so good that they allow for feats the player normally wouldn't achieve alone. It's highly recommended to farm favor for these units whenever they become available. One such insane unit is titled the Fieldmaster, which can be bought using Horseshoe Favor. The Fieldmaster unit can summon walls that block enemy projectiles and interfere with enemy AI, which helps the player survive longer. The walls prevent the enemy from attacking your totems and serve as a shield from generated projectiles. The text presents personal opinion on the best units in a game (presumably strategy or combat based), including their roles and capabilities. 

1. An unnamed unit is presented as the best in the game with both offensive and defensive capabilities. This unit is suggested to be positioned either as a "flanker," "attacker," or "defender," in that order based on availability. 
2. The Thunderbird from Valarco is the best offensive unit in the game, characterized by its speed and the ability to immediately teleport across the field ("lightning warps"). This allows the unit to bypass enemy battles and walls created by the "field master." This unit is ideal for speed clearing due to its pace and ability to attack the enemy base quickly.
3. The last mentioned unit is the Caldera Ravager, which becomes available later in the rounds, specifically after the third or fourth round. Its capabilities aren't detailed in the provided section of the text.

In terms of strategy: 
- Players are recommended to try the first unnamed unit, as it highly influences the outcome of games.
- The Thunderbird should be prioritized for its offensive capabilities. 
- Gameplay tactics include favoring certain spots on the board when aiming for rewards.
 The text discusses two game units named Kome's favor and Spear Fisher in a yet unspecified video game. The properties of Kome's favor include the ability to put down about five or six cremations upon spawning, each lasting around 10 to 20 seconds. These cremations interrupt everything within its radius and allows the unit to simultaneously handle multiple units. Another key feature of Kome's favor is its high resilience, which makes it great for both offensive and defensive operations. However, it is a bit expensive and not always available.

The other unit being discussed, the Spear Fisher, is a defender coming from an unspecified vendor and also has the ability to attack from a distance. Its attacks involve spamming ranged basic attacks and a special move called ensnare, which considerably slows down enemy units. This slowing ability is specifically critical as it reduces the mobility of enemy units, diminishing their speed towards the player and totems. The author appreciates the capabilities of the Spear Fisher and always tries to place them in a defensive position as soon as possible. The text gives advice about which units to go for and which to avoid in a game, emphasizing cost efficiency. Top recommended units are not specified but are described as reasonably cheap and cost efficient. However, more powerful units in yellow and green are harder to obtain and not worth their high cost. The text warns against “bad” units including Fire Breather from Kalm (always sets himself on fire, fails to defend or channel totems), Satanic Shell (extremely slow, overpriced at $2,300), Consuming Tuna Tuna (spends too long consuming dead enemies, stuns himself, not contributing), Frenzy Monger (similar to Fire Breather, kills itself), and Lunar Turtle (too slow, not good value for cost). The preferred alternative to a Lunar Turtle is buying Fieldmasters. Further efficiency tips are anticipated. The text describes a strategy for optimal shopping in a game. The goal is to maximize the number of units on the playing board, with a focus on flankers, attackers, escorts, and a few defenders. Replacing any yellow and red units with green or purple ones is advised. The aim is also to acquire as many purple units as early as possible. This involves checking "favor", particularly for good types like horseshoes, shields, white swirlies, and comb. The character Nivali is referenced as an initial stop for buying a unit, utilizing a ctrl-click for quick vendor window access. Jade Hulk, a green unit, may also be purchased if favour with the Jade is high enough. If there's not enough favor with Combe to buy a Fieldmaster, the player might consider moving favor from other masters or selling bad units, but maintaining a high number of units on the board remains paramount. As such, the preference is to shift favour from other vendors to this one. The character Novali can also provide equipment, and Combe can provide a unit. The text discusses strategies for buying, selling, and positioning units in a game. These units include:

1. The Thunderbird: This is an extremely efficient unit which should always go in the Flanker position. Players should stop buying them once they have four.
 
2. The Fieldmaster: This unit should fill any remaining Flanker positions after placing Thunderbirds. If there are more Fieldmasters, they can be placed in the Attacker position and if no more room, in Defender position.
  
3. Caldera Ravagers: Players should prioritize the placement of Caldera Ravagers in Attacker positions. If there are more, they can be placed in Defender positions.

4. Spearfisher: This unit is best placed in the Defender position. Once players have four, no more need to be bought and players can direct their resources elsewhere. 

For remaining positions, bulky units should be placed in the front and fast units in flank position (such as the Tuatara). Unwanted or garbage Nivala units should be placed in the Escort position for channeling Totems. Defender positions are suggested to be filled with either a ranged or a bulky unit. Lastly, the text suggests that understanding enemies is key in order to avoid problematic encounters. The text discusses three types of enemy characters in a game that one should exercise extreme caution around: Ahuana, Rakiata, and Hidecora. Ahuana, labelled as "Bow Chick", comes with a team of Spear Dancers who have the ability to instantly eliminate the player. Rakiata's allies place deadly bear traps that can cause major damage to the player. The third enemy type, Hidecora, not only causes large scale chaos explosions, but also has allies who set up force fields represented as totems. Besides these three, the player should also be wary of the Thunderbird, the speed answer, and the trawler units. The Thunderbird unit, if in significant numbers, has the ability to outdo your defense and win in a base race. The speed answer is capable of one-shot kills, and the trawler sets up bear traps that can injure the player. The text suggests caution especially during base races with these units. The text is discussing a strategy for a battle in a game where the player is warning others against running into the enemy base as it could result in a massive loss. The commentator mentions the unit 'Titanic Shell' on the enemy's team, which should be targeted by inflicting own damage but may pose a challenge for a low damage build or a ZDPS build. The player subsequently describes a 1700 rating match against Utula. The player's team includes two Caldera Ravages, a Thunderbird, several Field Masters, and additional green and purple units. The enemy lacks units deemed as dangerous, such as speedances, trawlers, except for one Thunderbird. Assessing the opposing team as weak, the player plans to initiate a base race. They wait for their escorts in the backlines and target blue totems on the map, indicating that their units are attacking. Despite the enemies' robust defence and a minor loss, the player's escorts manage to do substantial work. The aim is not to lose significant progress on their own base while trying to infiltrate the enemy's base. The speaker is engaged in a competitive activity, possibly a game, with the objective of taking down 'totems' with the help of teammates, referred as 'escorts'. They attempt to avoid getting stunned so they do not risk death, which would make the escorts retreat back to base. The team prioritizes attacking the same totems together. They have trouble facing some dangerous opponents, such as Caldera Ravagers and Thunderbirds, but also receive help from Fieldmasters that provide defense. They also encounter a healing totem, forcing them to switch their target. One of the enemies mentioned is a Bloodbound Warrior. They also make note of a powerful attack called the Chaos Degen by Hinokora used by an enemy named Utula. The speaker appears to be playing a game where they've gained an advantage over the enemy and are expected to win. There's a game mechanic involving 'totems', associated with enemy entities, which need to be killed/destroyed. Once killed, the speaker intends to "channel" (interact with) the fallen enemy's totem quickly to prevent the enemy from respawning. The enemies respawn every two seconds if the totem is not interacted with, enhancing the challenge. A 'base race strategy' has been suggested, where stunning totems prevents enemies from respawning, a smart strategy in this situation. The speaker also mentioned two different approaches to the mechanic: the 'full damage' approach, where maximum damage is dealt to enemy units, and the 'Z DPS' approach, focusing more on crowd control. Lastly, continually killing enemies might be needed, as they respawn swiftly. The text suggests several strategies for a game. The first strategy advocates using your allies to fully channel on all the totems without any interruption. However, in the end game, there will be deep delve scaling making opponents very tanky and you might need 20 to 40 million damage to succeed. If one dies in the game, there's a risk of losing. Totem or minion builds are recommended. The second approach suggests a Z DPS build with a focus on crowd control. Even with nerfs to crowd-control, slowing enemies down by 50% is still strong. You can alternate between channeling on totems and controlling enemy units. You can also knock back enemies off totems which is useful for disruption, and when combined with slowing, can be a strong tactic. A build focused on a full tank is another possibility, with about 13k life and maximum resistance. If such a character doesn't die, the escorts can do most of the work, shuttling totems and being disruptive. Combining this with crowd control could be very effective. A third strategy involves using Frost Wall, which hasn't been tested yet, believed to be highly effective at interrupting, particularly against dangerous units like the Thunderbird and the Spear Dancer. The text talks about a gaming strategy involving the use of phasing and Frost Wall for a totem. This tactic allows the player to remain inaccessible to enemies while concurrently channeling the totem, rendering the enemies incapable of disrupting the process. The speaker, however, admits they have not tested this theory. The speaker intends to provide informative content to enhance the viewers' gaming experience while expressing a desire for a deeper analysis due to the vastness of the topic. They conclude by expressing hope that the viewers have enjoyed the video and wish them well until their next interaction.
