The video by Grim is about the reward system of the game 'Trial of the Ancestors'. A frequently asked question about the game is whether the rewards get better with a higher rank, including rarer tattoos or more currency. Grim tried answering this question by increasing his own game rank. Previously, at rank 450, he found the rewards underwhelming. Acting on comments suggesting better rewards at higher ranks, Grim pushed his ranking to rank 1000 where he noticed the gameplay gets tougher. He plans to share strategies on tackling the higher level tactics in his next video. 

In the present video, Grim focuses on the loot at higher ranks. The prevalent theory is that exceptional rare drops in 'Trial of the Ancestors' only happen at higher ranking. Notable drops like specific tattoos, certain omens, and the unique currency 'Hinotora's Lock of Hair' are said not to drop before reaching a certain rank. The rank hasn't been established yet. The text discusses the correlation between higher rankings in a game (?) and the quality of loot or rewards received. The initial ranking was between 500 and 600, with some suggesting it might be around 650. The player notes that once you surpass this point, one can get bigger, more expensive rewards. The speaker has gathered information from playing and testing this theory, farming at higher points for a long period of time. They conducted 49 tournaments after an initial 10, starting at a ranking of 300 and ending at 1000. Their findings suggest that there is a significant increase in loot quality at higher rankings, specifically noted around the 550 ranking mark, contradicting the initial assumption. They began getting rarer items like honored tattoos which they had not received at lower rankings. They also started receiving makanga tattoos, another significant item not obtained below the 550 ranking. Other players have reported getting the lock of Hinakoro's hair, better omens, and unique items at higher ranks. The author strongly believes that there are some rewards gated behind higher rankings based on their experience. The text discusses the outcomes of a character's participation in 59 in-game tournaments, noting that rewards do improve. The character managed to gather rewards from 56 tournaments as they failed three at the final round. The missed rewards from the failed tournaments included two Divines, 10 Instilling Orbs, and three Honored Tattoos. However, the results indicate that the rewards are better at lower ranks. The author suggests that serious farming of rewards should not be attempted until reaching a ranking of around 550-600. Note that the results are mixed due to the varying ranks of the tournaments they participated in, so it's not possible to definitively say how profitable the mechanic is. The concluding element of the text mentions there will be a breakdown of the loot and earnings from the tournaments, but this is not provided within the given text. The user has spent approximately 407 rounds in a game, which required use of 407 silver coins. It took them 15 hours to complete, using the average time it took for them for each round. They used new technology recommended by the community to improve their performance, enjoying the process. 

In terms of earnings, the user made 1,061 C from non-exclusive rewards: two divine symbol's, five annulments, and six exaltations. However, they also lost potential earnings due to mistakes, specifically two additional divines, 10 instilling orbs, and three honored tattoos. The total non-exclusive earnings would then calculate to 1,400 C. 

They received 15 T1 currencies during 59 rounds and tournaments. They noticed a pattern that these tier one currencies only appear after the sixth round, along with other high-value rewards such as good tattoos, forbidden tomes, wing scarabs, akin to rewards found on the fourth floor of a location known as Sanctum. The text appears to detail a gaming strategy wherein it is possible to extend a tournament from round six to even round nine. While not fully maximized in the test, it was demonstrated that using this strategy was able to increase rank significantly and it is suggested that extending the tournament could likely yield even more currency than shown. During the test, priority was given to obtaining tier one currencies and the user obtained 1,400 C currency. A large part of the game's currency income comes from farming tattoos after reaching 550 to 600 in the game, realized during 59 matches. A significant amount of valuable tattoos, termed "big tattoos," totaling in worth of 4,000 chaos were obtained. A prominent portion of the income was due to four specific tattoos: the Tattoo of the Wise, Hunter, Berserker, and the Storm, which made up over half of the total income. It is noted that these were "honored" tattoos of a different coloration, suspected to only drop after reaching over 550 in the game. The speaker obtained four special tattoos (the "good tattoos") from runs, indicating that more could have been received with more matches. Other participants reported receiving multiple power charge tattoos during their runs. Additional valued tattoos included makanga and loyalty tattoos. They also noted that other worthwhile tattoos included ones named Warmonger, Sniper, Warcrawler, and Turtle. Features of these tattoos could entail decreased chance to be crit, warcry, cooldown reduction, and projectile speed boosting, for instance. The only other profitable item was the flask duration tattoo, albeit none were obtained. All other tattoos were classified as bulk, valued at 3C each, leading to a total of 118 bulk tattoos from the run. The run also garnered a few "omens," specifically Omen of the Jeweler and Omen of Blanching. The total value made, including failed runs, was 4,624C from tattoos. Together with an existing sum of 1,400, the final total is 36.7 divines. In terms of yield per hour, this equates to around 2.4 divines. The speaker suggests this amount may not seem significant, but further insight will be given in the next section of the discussion. The speaker discusses strategies for maximizing returns in a game, potentially a tournament style game involving various clans. Major points include:

1. A player can potentially earn four or five "divines" per hour with an efficient and fast approach. 
2. Many factors can influence the efficiency of playing. 
3. Players should not eliminate certain clan members (possibly NPCs) that offer the best rewards. The speaker lists five of these such members, which are Kaom, Mata, Ahuana, Ikiawa and Rai. 
4. These members should ideally be kept in the game till later rounds, as the best rewards, including exclusive items, special currencies (mentioned as T1 currencies), and Makanga tattoos, appear from round six onward. 
5. The speaker shares a strategy of killing off other characters that are not essential, which is recorded in their 'kill' spreadsheet. 
6. The ranking of the player at the method's initiation, the speed of matches, and the changing prices of tattoos are contributory factors to the defined success. A good build for the player's character is also important. 
7. Other factors not yet included in the testing process were mentioned, indicating scope for future optimization strategies.
 The text gives strategic advice for a game. The first tip is to keep certain characters alive until at least round six to get 'rare tattoos' and 'rare uniques'. These rare assets can be sold and will increase overall earnings. It's mentioned that 'uniques' are worth 'three div' each and are rare, the speaker encountered two in their 59 matches. The other crucial tip offered is to try to extend the number of rounds played and keeping the maximum number of players alive for as long as possible. By doing so, the players increase their chances of getting Mikonga tattoos and Divines. It's also pointed out that you can get Divines in stack sizes more than one, evidenced by a clip of a player who received five Divines in the final round. The speaker also recommends intentionally losing a match in later rounds to reset rewards and potentially get better ones. This is advised when players reach round six and don't find any desired rewards. After failing and coming back, the rewards will be refreshed. 1. The current method of increasing rewards in a game is time-consuming and frustrating, involving multiple loading screens and possible lagging.
2. A forthcoming patch will introduce a forfeit button to make the process quicker to reroll rewards.
3. Apart from a few exceptions, there are no substantial rewards until reaching level six in the game.
4. Focusing on earning favor allows players to create powerful unit compositions that can swiftly defeat the enemy team.
5. Early rounds can potentially be completed in 20-30 seconds, significantly increasing clear speed.
6. The author finished faster than an estimated 15 hours due to new strategies.
7. Another forthcoming update will increase the amount of favor gained from games, enabling players to create more powerful teams and speed up their games even more. This update is expected to be released in the near future. The text discusses a game strategy involving maintaining a high rank for better currency rewards. Some points made include the use of rerolls after the sixth round and aiming for a 550 to 600 rank before concentrating on currency accumulation. The narrator is uncertain if rewards increase as one's rank goes over 600 and it is mentioned that the game's difficulty level escalates significantly after a 900 rank. Even though the rank cap is 2,000, reaching it is considered challenging especially for solo players. The narrator also mentions an in-game item, the Tattoo of the Storms, suggesting its acquisition might have influenced their positive gaming experience. However, they did not get other valuable in-game items like the Mikanga ones, Uniques, and Omens or the costly Hinokoro's Luck. The narrator concludes that the time spent in the game wasn't wasted and ponders whether their currency collecting was as effective as competing games like Legion or Delirium orbs. The speaker is voicing their opinion on the emerging trends, particularly the rising prices of tattoos and the increased interest from the public. They express optimism about the current dynamics and encourage others to engage, especially if they enjoy it. Based on their experiences, they noticed that profits (making money) are more significant with higher investments or stages (higher ranks). They ask viewers to try and advance to these stages if they want to make money. The speaker also mentions that they have created a previous video on the same topic.
