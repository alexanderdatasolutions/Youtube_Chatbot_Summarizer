The information is about Karim's new strategy to make currency in the game, League Start, with use of a new progression Atlas passive tree. In contrast to past strategies which entailed Essence, Strombox, and Expedition, the new approach requires a move up the center of the tree to Wandering Path. Wandering Path doubles the effect of all small Atlas passive skills while disabling notables. The nodes that need to be doubled are those which offer a certain percentage chance for a monster in each map to drop an additional connected map. Upon taking enough such nodes, you can boost that chance to 100%, ensuring that every time you run a map you'll drop a connected map, granting infinite map sustain. This strategy is suitable for builds that don't require significant currency, like Lightning Arrow. The described strategy offers the potential for fast game progression through a connected map feature. The connected maps feature ensures that maps are always tier-appropriate, often tier higher. It allows targeting of maps adjacent to already owned ones, which can help increase completion levels. The connected map system also provides a bigger map pool than what would normally drop, offering abundant map options and resale opportunities. This strategy can help players ascend the tiers faster. Additional perks include a 100% map sustain, connected map tech, and T.R.A.C. nodes. These nodes offer a higher chance to obtain more T.R.AC. modifiers and missions than usual. T.R.A.C.'s missions bring a full set of maps that could be of higher tiers and those not yet completed. Moreover, these obtained maps contribute significantly to atlas progression by providing more maps for runs, including those not attempted before. This productive strategy allows players to achieve Exarch and Eda levels faster.
 The text outlines a strategy to progress through a game and build a map pool. Key points include: 

- The player can progress from Act 10 through Tiers 1, 2, 3, up to T16 maps in 4-6 hours.
- Once a map is received from an atlas passive tree, the player can kill the boss and leave without needing to full clear the map.
- Player already has sustain checked off on the list.
- Player plans to use this strategy at league start and recommends that others try it too.
- Points allocation strategy is presented, leading to a 100% chance to sustain the map pool.
- Progressing this way will lead the player to get Exarch and Eater of World Ultis online and ready.
- Player will stick with the Wandering Path strategy after they kill the Sirian Exarch and Eater of Worlds, using it to build a T16 map pool of 20-30 maps. 
- Afterward, a new Atlas Passive strategy will be adopted. The text discusses strategies for a game, possibly a role-playing game (RPG), that involves choosing among different progression paths or "trees". Two strategies under consideration are "Legion" and "Heist Essence", with the option of using "Seventh Gate". One suggestion made is that after finishing the "Wandering Path tree", players should invest their remaining "Atlas Passive points" into the tree they plan to farm in the end game. 

The "Legion" strategy is discussed in more detail; it has three significant changes in patch 3.22. Firstly, "Legion" has become a Keurig modifier which increases profitability and accessibility as it allows players to conduct multiple legions per map without the need for "Scarabs and Sextants". This could potentially increase its viability in the league spot. 

Secondly, "five-way farming" (a method that may involve using five different resources or strategies concurrently) has been nerfed, impacting the profitability of suppliers of 5-way emblems. It's likely that these patches and changes have a significant impact on gameplay strategy but further context would clarify this. Boosting is a preferred method for power leveling players in gaming. Despite changes, it is expected that buying and selling emblems will continue. The introduction of two new items, silver coins and sanctum maps, provides a new revenue stream. These items are easily acquired, particularly from the game 'Legion', where more monsters you slay results in obtaining more of these items. Legion is therefore a recommended game for solo players to increase their silver coins and sanctum maps obtainment. Plus, it provides potential for a notable increase in profit and revenue.

Using the 'stream of consciousness' strategy, a player can chisel a tier 14 to T16 map dropped from wandering path farm, vile it, and use it with the map device and a 'Kirak Legion' to increase the profit. The player pointed out that scarabs and Legion compasses could be challenging to acquire in the first few days, and trading could consume much time. Therefore, this strategy, in combination with the new Kirak modifier, seems beneficial. The text discusses two key strategies for maximizing currency in a game involving maps, such as Path of Exile. 

The first strategy involves using an atlas passive skill tree specialized for maximum currency gain through the use of domination shrines, map nodes, and legion nodes. The ultimate goal is to unlock favorite slots, with particular emphasis on the dunes map, identified as the best for legions in the new patch. Once enough favorites to access dunes have been achieved, the atlas passive skill tree can be modified. It's also mentioned that given time, scarabs would be available for use. This strategy is specialized for endgame legion and full detail can be found on Maxwell GG after league releases. 

The second strategy considered is the 7th Gate Heist Essence Speed Farming strategy, which involves using Searing Exarch Altars. This approach requires taking any Tier 14 to 16 map, modifying it with chisel and alch, running the map with the Heist Tier Arc Modifier, collecting caches and essences, defeating the boss, and repeating. This doesn't necessitate gathering a bunch of favorites or Void Stones, making it an easy shift from the Wandering Path strategy. This is presented as a fun play style as well. The text discusses the benefits of implementing the 7th Gate strategy in a game. The 7th Gate gives you access to all Tier Arc Modifiers, including the heist modifier not available in the current league. Players who don't use the 7th Gate are at a disadvantage, as it provides significant market power, offering increased heist contracts, blueprints, and potential for better pricing. This strategy also has a high number of monster kills per hour, increasing the chance of obtaining silver coins and sanctum books to sell in the open market.

The author is still deciding between two strategies - Heist Essence or Legion. Heist Essence may provide a stronger advantage early in the game and is accessible to a larger number of builds. It also offers an edge over players unaware of 7th Gate. On the other hand, Legion is a proven strategy that scales significantly into the endgame, especially with benefits like incubators, the Legion sets, and the Kirak modifier on the map for Legion. 

The author concludes considering running either Heist Essence early for an advantage or Legion for late game scaling. The speaker is discussing strategies for a game, which involve using a character or feature, referred to as the 'Mechanic.' They plan to use their own in-game currency (silver coins) to test the profitability of the Mechanic. They also suggest using other strategies such as Expedition, Delirium Orbs, Delirium Mirrors, Harvest, and The Works, with an emphasis on Blight being beneficial for League Start. The speaker mentions a site, MaxwellGG, where updated guides for version 3.22 can be found. The speech concludes with a note about game strategy plans and a wish for the listener's enjoyment.
