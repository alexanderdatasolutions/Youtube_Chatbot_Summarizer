Karim, a video blogger, gives his four reasons for continuing to use Lightning Arrow as the starting league despite its recent nerf. Lightning Arrow previously used Vengeant Cascade, a notable anointed with two gold oils and an amber oil. This allows all projectiles fired to return back to the player, significantly increasing clear and single-target damage. However, Vengeant Cascade has essentially been removed, replaced with a less effective support gem, leading many players to discard this mechanic.

Despite this, Karim has successfully used this build prior to Vengeant Cascade's inclusion in patch 320 and believes it remains effective. He argues that Lightning Arrow is still potentially the best league starting build for players interested in fast gameplay, bow builds, and currency accumulation.

Lightning Arrow is a simple build requiring two skills. The primary skill, Lightning Arrow, clears packs of monsters. When encountering a difficult enemy, players can use artillery ballistas to do significant single-target damage. 

Most Lightning Arrow guides suggest using Deadeye as their ascendancy, but Raider is also a suitable choice. The choice of items can vary. The text describes a build for an advanced player that is familiar with the bow play style. The build is potentially excellent for the new league mechanic because it uses artillery ballista totems, which can cause the majority of single target damage. This allows the player to dodge around and respond to other requirements of the game mechanic. The build is particularly suitable for the new trial of the Ancestors League with rogue exile style enemies and massive telegraphed attacks. These enemies tend to focus on the totems, giving player time to handle other mechanics or dodge incoming attacks. The build is possibly good for new keystones, specifically the new Expedition one. It can deal with immunity remnants because it can cause tri-elemental damage in the form of fire, lightning, and cold damage. This build allows running the new Expedition keystone with fewer downsides. The following information was extracted from the text:

1. Lightning Arrow is an effective tool for farming in league starters, especially for those interested in the beyond keystone.
2. This tool is fast at clearing all map layouts, making it a top choice for currency making; it essentially allows more maps to be completed per hour, leading to more currency.
3. Lightning Arrow is effective in clearing Exarch and Eater of Worlds altars and defeating the boss at the end, making it a significant part of currency strategies.
4. It is capable of effectively clearing the most profitable end game league mechanic farms, including Legion, Delirium, Mirrors or Orbs, Expedition or Blight. 
5. The tool is considered strong in all stages: early game, mid-game, and end game. For the early game, a strong character is necessary.
6. To maintain strength, the user must find the right socket colors, specifically green sockets. This is easier for rangers. The text seems to be providing an evaluation of a certain build for a game, possibly for the game 'Path of Exile'. The build in question appears to be a ranger-type, specifically focusing on bow enhancements. Key points include: 

1. The ease of finding and upgrading bows along the gameplay, which would lead to a smooth progression through act one to act ten. 
2. A power curve that continues to rise even after the acts and provides surprises by tier one maps.
3. The build's ability to go from tier one maps to Exarch and Eda completely solo self-found. Players have been having successful runs in under 10 hours.
4. The new 'wandering path atlas passive tree technology' has brought improvements in gameplay.
5. In the endgame, this build becomes even stronger and versatile, allowing it to become one of the most potent mapping characters.
6. The possibility of transitioning the build into stronger ranger builds, like Venom Gyre or Tornado Shot.
7. The ranger class is noted as one of the strongest end-game ascendancies and classes. 
8. The build's ability to take full advantage of cheat mechanics to increase clear speed dramatically over other builds, such as the Rampage mechanic which can be easily be equipped.
 This text talks about a specific unidentified build that can run different items, including Bisco's Leash, a pair of gloves that provide Berserk, and Death Rush. Bisco's Leash can offer movement speed and increased damage. The pair of gloves boosted by Berserk also increase movement speed, damage, and damage mitigation. Death Rush provides adrenaline that multiplies speed and damage further, boosting overall performance.

This build allows the use of a unique, jewel-inspired item called Learning, enhancing performance, especially if the build is run with Legion or Delirium. The build can utilize the positions of Learning in two different ways in the tree, or even run two Learnings simultaneously. It's noted they're comparable to a mini-headhunter, but cheaper and easier to assimilate into the build.

The build also supports a specific Atlas passive strategy referred to as Packed with Energy, a particular node on the tree that activates a buff providing movement speed, damage, and maximum resources whenever a Sulphite Vein or chest is obtained. It has been stressed that in the endgame, Sulphite Scarabs and this node should be deployed on every map due to their high efficiency. The text discusses the effectiveness of combining Lightning Arrow character with shrines and Artillery Ballista in a game. All shrine nodes, when picked up, allow the character to attain higher speed and damage capacities. Shrines are especially beneficial to Lightning Arrow, making difficult content easier and faster to handle. Players can much more easily tackle challenging content, giving them momentum, boost, and a significant edge over the game economy. The combination of Lightning Arrow and Artillery Ballista offers excellent mapping and blasting league starter abilities. The author recommends this combination as a powerful strategy and encourages individuals interested in starting mapping to try it out. The author also mentions the guide 3.21 as still being fully applicable and proposes checking out CrouchingTuna's video and Maxwell guide for a full comprehensive written version, implying these to be quality resources for players.
