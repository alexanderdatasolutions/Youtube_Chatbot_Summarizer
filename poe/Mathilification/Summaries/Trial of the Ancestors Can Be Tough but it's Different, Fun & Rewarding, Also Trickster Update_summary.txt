Matthew is discussing a new mechanic in a video game called "Trial of the Ancestors". This mechanic involves an entirely separate game zone to which players have access once they have acquired silver coins. The area is home to different tribes that you engage with in combat and trade. Players can buy and sell units and equipment for these units.

Although it detracted from campaign progress due to its challenging nature and lack of rewards suitable for the campaign, Matthew found it engaging and does not regret participating. It took him approximately 12 hours to finish the campaign with this character, with 3 hours dedicated to exploring the "Trial of the Ancestors" mechanic. 

Matthew also provided an update on the Aetherial Knives Trickster Starter, his personal game character. While he finds the Trickster to be performing well, it needs fine-tuning, primarily in the management of mana and incremental upgrades. The potential rewards from the "Trial of the Ancestors" include extra favor, which allows players to buy more units thereby facilitating their progress. Spending silver coins your character has collected allows access to this mechanic.
 The text describes a strategy in a battle system in a game. The player's ranking increases as they win more games, which in turn, increases the difficulty level of the game. One of the difficulties noted is an uptick in monster level which can cause the player to be defeated quickly. The rewards of the game involve favor or items and can be significant, with mention of a Divine Orb and Six Link, with the rewards from the game mechanism being a key source of earnings for the player.

In terms of gameplay, the player starts with a list of minions that increases as they progress. These minions can be assigned roles such as attackers, escorts, or flankers. Flankers, who directly attack enemy totems, are particularly vital. The objective of the game is to destroy all of the enemy’s totems. The chosen strategy is to assign some minions to defense or escort roles, securing the base while flankers destroy the enemy's totems. This strategy can be refined as the player gains more minions and gains further experience in the game. The text discusses strategies for a combat game involving flanking enemies and defensive play. The player is tasked with maximizing their flankers and focusing on mid-combat. If the player struggles, it is suggested to bolster defensive efforts. When the player starts a battle, the potential for being defeated quickly is high. However, the game allows the player to resurrect and continue fighting. The player has utilized blade blast EK, and void sphere abilities effectively. Enemies tend to feel stronger than player's teammates and as player's level increases, the chances of a quick defeat rises. The strategy involves occupying the field as much as possible, and as the player progresses, the game becomes more challenging with more enemies on the field. In-game purchases and sells are available, which involves buying items to enhance a specific minion's ability. A minion must be removed from the field to attach these items. The purchasing power is dependent on the amount of favor the player has available. The text refers to a strategy in a game, possibly Path of Exile (PoE), involving buying, selling, and using units/minions/equipment. One strategy is selling a less useful minion to afford a better one. Another tactic involves stacking favor in one area. The "turtle" unit is mentioned as a powerful one, able to tank and flank, but it is expensive. The speaker encourages keeping opponents busy in the midfield, letting teammates flank and kill. The strategy can be fun despite its complexity with initial battles being chaotic. The speaker expresses satisfaction with the game mechanics and enjoys engaging with the content. The text seems to discuss strategies for a video game which seems to involve combating minions and totems controlled by opponents. The aim is to keep minions occupied while flankers target and destroy other totems or kill enemies, causing them to take longer to respawn. This gradually results in a one-way battle swinging in favor of the player. The flanker strategy is used widely, particularly in higher tier play, but the game also relies on players devising other effective strategies. The game has a reward structure that is satisfying at higher tiers, yielding things like tattoos which enhance passive abilities. These game changing enhancements can be accumulated and placed strategically. The player's own character is the Theron Ives trickster, which is still under development. Despite not yet being fully coded, the character's performance is described as satisfactory thus far, without notable stagnation in the gameplay.
 Theron Ives has been successfully managing his game strategies despite some initial mana issues. He put clarity on arrogance, allowing the command to cast off his life. Some small upgrades have been necessary for early mapping. He primarily uses EK as his damage source, but also uses Blade Blast for extra targeted damage. He had to incorporate slower Proj mastery to assist with a Returned Proj issue. A potential next step might be to acquire the Aetheru Knives Circle Helm enchant to boost Blade Blast. 

The character's name in the game is 'level 79-1div' which can be imported by users in Path of Building software. Mathel’s gaming account, can be used for importing the character data and following their progress. Current equipment includes a five-link item that was bought for 3C and has been augmented with Evasion Energy Shield, ensuring increased character resilience due to a larger base of Evasion and Energy Shield, also helpful for Ghost Shrouds. The next plan is to introduce Grace into the build and possibly replace Vitality. The speaker is discussing a highly basic character build in a video game. The character relies mostly on Evasion and an ability or function called freeze. The speaker's in-game items are valued around five to 10 Cs and are mainly chosen for life and resist options. Tips are provided for better game play such as adding Car Speed to items including amulet, wand, and rings. The speaker is wearing a belt from 100 levels ago and they believe their items are not of good quality. They have resolved a mana problem with a 'clarity' ability and an enduring mana flask, but acknowledges it's not ideal. Another manner solution involved a mastery that causes skills to cost life instead of mana. The speaker mentions a specific path they took to reach their current point in their game level and mentions future actions including obtaining "suppress" and completing a 'uber lab'. Some of their gear includes a wand with certain beneficial stats, and the speaker's abilities are linked with ethereal knives, crit damage, crit strike, spell echo, and return proj. The following step might be to include pinpoint ability, they also consider cold penetration and room sorrows for their build. The statement ends around the idea of a need for cold penetration and potentially fully converting to room sorrows, though this is a tentative plan. The speaker is discussing a game strategy using Blade Blast, currently linked with Crit Strikes, Area, and Crit Damage. A level 21 Blade Blast was purchased for 6 Chaos because they're economical. Blade Blast is used with Area to enhance overlap, and this setup might be improved with a better setup with EK. Return Proj sometimes fires behind, which is somewhat corrected by a Mastery for lesser Proj Speed. Avoiding Proj Speed helps prevent it from landing behind more often. Using the Area Enchant might allow for more Proj Speed and better Blade Blast performance. The next step involves integrating it into a system with higher levels. The speaker's character is apparently advancing smoothly into early white and yellow maps and should continue doing so with proper upgrades. The speaker encourages viewers to follow the progress through the path of building and to ask any questions during the live stream. Other strategies like Stormburst Totems and Ice Shot Jedi are also working well.
