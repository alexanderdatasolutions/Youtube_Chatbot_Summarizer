The speaker, Matthew, is discussing starter builds for the "Trial of the Ancestors League", noting that while there haven't been many changes to initial skills, the introduction of new support gems and shifting meta throughout the league will influence gameplay. He suggests that existing support systems and strategies from previous leagues can still be used effectively, and details three effective starter builds: Ice Shot, Aetheru Knives, and Trickster with Blade Blast, along with Cold base and a Stormburst Totem setup that can scale into shockwave totems. He proceeds to illustrate the Ice Shot Deadeye build, which he personally used in the last league, Crucible League. He finds bow builds generally to be in a good place for starting out, and introduces the new Vial Ice Shot and Vial Lightning Arrow that can customize the build further. He describes Ice Shot as being based entirely on cold and capable of producing additional single targets through the Vial Ice Shot. He mentions that in the last league, the build was done with snipers marks leading to projectiles being launched. The text primarily explains the impact of the removal of Vengeant Cascade from a certain league game on projectile-based builds. The writer affirms that despite its absence, players can still use return projectiles for more projectiles. Vengeant Cascade was instrumental in taking a build into "uber territory" without a large budget. Even without Vengeant Cascade, a starter can smoothly navigate to the basic endgame. The writer began using Vengeant Cascade at level 85 or during red tier maps on a budget gear and basic setup, and it led him through to the endgame. For the next league, the writer plans to have a base template for about level 60, and a level 95 character for killing uber bosses. However, due to the removal of Vengeant Cascade, an additional proj will have to be incorporated in the form of a support and something else will have to be taken out, which might be Mirage Archer or Bone Chill. The writer suggests trying out Ice Shot or Lightning Arrow and avoiding basing starters or anything else in the game on the ability to kill uber bosses. The text alludes to the addition of the crucible mechanic in the game but provides no detailed explanation. The text talks about game strategies with two particular builds: bow and ethereal knives trickster. The bow build benefits a little from pace and ancestral tattoos. Ideal for beginners, these bow builds are generally 'soft core' - it's possible to downgrade defenses and invest more in offense. However, good defense can be developed through evasion, life pull, spell suppression and Kintsugi. Kintsugi significantly enhances the player's tank factor, which is advantageous when focusing more on defense. Otherwise, working on the offense is recommended as that serves as the best defense for a bow user. 

The second build discussed is the Ethereal Knives Trickster, which is more versatile but requires more gear for an appropriate build. It features returning projectiles which make it quite effective when used with Blade Blast. The ethereal knives can function well with return projectiles, a level 38 support. Having Blade Blast as a secondary single-target setup helps when there isn't enough gear to scale the build. The ethereal knives' trickster is ideal for the later phases of game mapping. The author has previously played a similar build during the crucible. The text discusses a league in a multiplayer game presumably Inquisitor being a popular character in that game. The "Inquisitor" is recognized for its "Aetheru knives" and "blade blast" skill set, which provides exceptionally potent damage output. The Inquisitor's strength is demonstrated even when four support characters are removed, thus providing good clear and single-target damage. The discussion also introduces the use of the "blade blast" as a helpful tool, useful when numerous blades are gathered for a powerful single-target burst. The end game POB (presumably an abbreviation for Path of Building, a theorycrafting tool) of a slightly modified "Trickster" is around 1-2 million DPS, while the "Inquisitor's" is around 2-3 million DPS. The text indicates that the "Trickster" should be able to handle end-game comfortably like the "Inquisitor". However, the author explains that the "Inquisitor" used high-grade items which players may not be able to replicate soon. Adjustments have been made, transforming the character into a "Shadow" and it is more beginner-friendly. Finally, the inquisitor will employ complete cold conversion, differing from the original character, moving forward need to figure out how exactly to build this character. A provisional tree for endgame was mentioned, presumably a strategy development or progression mechanism in the game which can offer decent DPS and simulate some end game damage. The character in question is designed with evasion, effective spells, and good leech, and is expected to tackle most content. The speaker will be the person to continue developing and updating this character, although there is a suggestion of attempting an inquisitor version, which requires the right gear. The speaker acknowledges that some features will be lacking, particularly the guardian node and the crucible tree and cast speed. 

The speaker has tested a starter version based on an Ethereal Knives (EK) build up to level 60, proving effective despite initial difficulties. The player starts with Theru knives, uses other spells like flame wall, and obtains blade blast at level 16. The gameplay begins to improve around level 20, or 25 upon obtaining hatred. Crit nodes are added before accessing the pierce feature. Returning Proj is expected to enable Blade Blast sooner at level 38 in the new league. 

The speaker emphasizes that the gear used during the trial was substandard, suggesting the build was robust despite the lack of high-quality equipment. They caution that it's a provisional build but expresses hope that it will prove beneficial and scalable even in new league. The useful information extracted from the text is:

- EK Blade Blast is a viable build once well-equipped.
- The second build highlighted is Stormburst Totems, with considerable potential but currently untested due to other commitments.
- The author was able to reach level 70 comfortably using HCI SSF, and level 60 in a crucible and standard setting. 
- Stormburst Totems can transition to Shockwave Totem for those who prefer that route, especially beneficial for Sanctum builds.
- An Astral Projector can significantly enhance the feel of the Shockwave Totem build.
- The Stormburst Totem build can seem chaotic due to numerous stormbursts but levels nicely.
- It can scale effectively into mid and late endgame with very little currency or gear.
- The build can yield up to 7 million DPS and a degree of tankiness.
- It could potentially use new Spellblade support with Energy Blade if a user would like to reroute the build, however, it is designed to be pure lightning.
- The build can also mimic the Shockwave Totem POB for pure endgame, with the possibility of a later transition.
- The author is considering starting with this build but thinks initial game focus should be on Theronives.
- The author will provide a 'levelling test' in the future. The user discusses their experience levelling up a character to level 60 with basic gear and how it compares to an endgame level 95 character with better gear. The endgame character has been equipped with a planned build path towards achieving 'totems.' Totems are a gameplay mechanics where a player can summon stationary units which autonomously attack enemies or provide certain benefits. They specifically mention a 'Shockwave totem' build from several leagues back that was one of their most successful, but now requires a significant investment in gear for endgame content.

They suggest that a Stormburst totem build might have the potential to surpass Shockwave totems in effectiveness, though it would entirely depend on the player's preferred playstyle. The Stormburst build involves managing the duration of 'balls' that the totem releases for damage. The key to maximizing the build's benefit is ensuring that the duration reaches specific 0.4 second thresholds for extra 'explosions.' It's recommended to monitor this while upgrading duration-enhancing items/skills throughout the game.

Lastly, the user describes a basic totem build path and also mentions passing through minion and physical damage (fizz) nodes on the skill tree, as these can later contribute to the player's damage output. The speaker shares their experience with the game, focusing on totem-based builds. They recall using two stormburst totems at level 15 via ancestral bond. Although this wasn't optimal, they found it good enough. They recommend using Stormblast Mine as an activity once two totems are set. If a player isn't inclined towards this immediately, the speaker suggests leveling with Rolling Magma, Flame Wall, etc. The first ascendancy is a good point to transition into totems, given that it allows for the third totem and superior placement speed. They mention the potential to review past game footage to understand their leveling process. The speaker moves on to note that different scaling systems can be used and mentions Doriani's prototype and Inquisitor as possibilities. Their best historical totem experience has been with the Shockwave Totem. They also mention considering the start of Stormburst, but currently focusing on EK (Ethereal Knives). The speaker is still exploring the best builds and is hopeful about finding something suitable for the start. They also laud the new supports in the game and highlight previous successful builds, predicting a promising league start. The speaker ends by hinting towards the Trial of Ascendancy, without providing further details. The speaker plans to be online one hour before the league launch, possibly participating in cosplay, and thanks the audience for watching. They also mention a context of having fun during an event called the Ancestors. They anticipate their next interaction with the audience and hint at preparing something for that future event.
