The text describes a game build for the game Path of Exile. The author focused on a saboteur build that uses the cast on crit ("cast on critical hit") strategy, particularly using ice nova and frost bolt attacks. Saboteurs in PoE are known for their traps and bombs, but in this case, the build focuses on the high movement and the ice attacks. 

The build is complex, being referred to as "a mess", and notably involves multiple frost bolts, with ice novas being cast on them with each critical hit. This build is unique because it uses bow setup instead of the more standard melee one. The author also purchased the illusionist ice nova microtransaction ("MTX"), a kind of in-game purchase that visually changes the ice nova attacks, which he found visually impressive, despite potentially overwhelming players with its visual effects, obscuring vision of enemies and causing the screen to be filled with images of frost bolts and ice novas. 

The author makes use of 'trigger bots', a saboteur specific feature, which doubles the triggers, meaning there are two cast on crits for the price of one, but at a lesser damage on each critical hit. Finally, the author provides an example where even without microtransactions the ice novas, frost bolts, and Herald of Ice still obscure vision under certain circumstances during gameplay. This build seems to be a trial run for a potential starting build in a new game season. The text refers to a video game character build using a bow cast on crit setup that reached level 90 easily. This build is flexible and can try out different spells and spell combos, making it a fun choice for gaming, despite not being the most recommended. It mapped well and was enjoyable, although it might be challenging for a first character because it requires initial resources. 

The build managed to defeat an uber (extremely tough enemy) boss, the Uber Eater of Worlds, although it wasn't designed for such challenges. This implies that this build may not have a good balance of mobility, defense, and damage which are essential for uber fights. 

The character build, as described, is a Level 92, Saboteur, with gameplay described as "D4, Bad, Peewee, Good," and 4.2k life. There are variations to this build - it can be modified to have more or less life, more energy shield, more evasion, etc. This particular build is only an example, not a definitive guide. The character in discussion is built around a cast-on-crit bow. To build this, one requires some capital and a shaped bow. Once the shaped bow is obtained, essences are spammed until cast-on-crit is hit. After ensuring a spare prefix, the player does "cannot roll attack mods", and then slams hoping to hit a good prefix. The player further locks prefixes and does suffix reroll with veil. The player also mentions the use of crucible for additional attack speed and cooldown recovery rate. The character setup includes Ice Nova, Divergent Inspiration, Crit strikes, Hyperthermia, Blast Rain, and Awakened Added Cold. The player uses Frostbolt setup with Asenath's Mark, GMP, Fast Approach, and Inspiration. When the character attacks, it releases Frostbolts, which then spawn Ice Novas upon crit. The player predicts a nerf in the projectile return mechanism but expects a reliable return proj in the next patch. The character also uses scorn essences for global crit multi on the quiver and has an elder and hunter attack and spell crit combination on the chest. The text is about the character build for a video game. The author managed to take care of the mana issue for his character by buying an Elrion -10 non-channeling ring from the market and putting a 20 quality on it, along with another -10 and a -12. He also mentioned using a mana flask. The author crafted his chest with added curse capabilities and did a caster reroll on prefixes. 

His Frostbolt is free and takes 14 life, while his Ice Nova costs 2 mana and 19 life. He also discussed a possible alternative for managing mana proposed as non-channel cost on Clarity, Watcher's Eye, yet he recommends constructing the character based on Eldritch Battery principles. 

He built his character in a way similar to how he started the league with the Saboteur, with features like cold exposure nerf and basic perks. He crafted some cooldown recovery, boots slammed together with cooldown recovery and tailwind; he also locked suffix and unveiled as per normal.

The character was built out of about 20 to 30 divines; while it took meticulous crafting, he noted that if played strategically, the setup could be achieved with about 10 divines.

This character has trigger bots that take over triggers, like cast on crit and assonance, leading to less damage but twice as many procs. The author selected the explosive expert and born in the shadows. The character is referred to as a Bokok character and it seems to be a saboteur type with around 4k life. The text discusses a game character's build featuring evasion, blind, good recovery, and spell suppress. The character’s sustain mainly comes from extra vitality and life gain on hit provided by a watcher's eye. The character also has critical multipliers present in jewels and a cluster with 'blanketed snow' and 'sadist', allowing for 10 penetration against chilled opponents and additional early damage. Curses include assassin mark with mark on hit, frostbite and early weakness, mainly used against bosses. Other abilities include arcanist brand, zealotry, lightened Grace, Herald of Ice, Flame Dash, Precision, Vitality, and Convocation. Convocation is used to keep the trigger bots nearby for effective attack procs. The build uses Cast on Crit, Ice Nova, Bow, Saboteur, making it a fun build but not optimal for Ubers. The character can be squishy, but certain abilities and attributes help minimize the amount of damage it takes.
