Matthew made a video about his upgrades for his Aetheria Knives Trickster, a blade blast build particularly for endgame. The build had a big issue with mana, so he initially used a mana flask for handling this. However, to avoid relying only on the mana flask, he used clarity on arrogance to put clarity on his life. Additionally, he used some pieces of gear and points from the passive tree to boost mana regeneration. This improved mana sustainability through casting, eliminating the dependence on a flask and the need for eldritch battery. Although the Aetherian Rending was used often for clearing, the primary source of single-target damage was the blade blast. Matthew speculated an AOE Nova Enchant or a Nime might improve the accuracy of the build, since blade blast often missed due to the blades not stacking well. This build was effective but recommended for players with higher budget, since the original EK build alone would not be sufficient. The text features a player discussing strategies, experiences, and updates to their character build in a game. The character is said to have excellent damage per second, some million DPS, and defensive skill sets, featuring evasion up to 40k and a solid energy shield. Despite the high evasion and the ghost dance, the character occasionally dies in Trial of the Ancestors. The character has improved to be able to rapidly eliminate enemies, unlike prior struggles at 250 to defeat anything in the Trial of the Ancestors. The player also started using Maven summon to add more bosses, which created chaotic gameplay, particularly challenging with bosses inflicting fire Degen and Gravisius guy's consistent sparks. While the character struggles against damage over time, they have robust defenses against hit-stuff thanks to evasion, ghost shrouds, and some instant leech. The player intends to continue through the endgame with their level 92 character but is considering a reroll to Arc Totems. The character build includes a level 21 Aetherial Knives, inspiration, and previously used Crit Strikes. The player is working diligently on progressing their Atlas and finishing each map. The text details a gaming strategy for level 21 which involves getting exposure, using Frost Bomb and Inspiration. Crit (critical) strikes were utilized until recently, and crit was attempted to be increased in every possible way. Crafting of a new hat involving 30 or 40 horror essences was carried out. The areas of focus while crafting were increased area or hypothermia. Blade blast, cold penetration, crit strikes, and crit damage were used in a five or six link gaming system. The immortal flesh was used primarily for life regeneration and a bit of mana regeneration, which were key for mid-to-end game play. Life leech replaced the need for immortal flesh, leading to an increased focus on chaos resistance. A weapon with cast speed, plus fizz, and some crit was obtained, which cost about 30-40c. Another item costing 60c, having plus fizz skills and some crit, was also mentioned. An amulet having any spell plus level was obtained, targeting specifically blade blast feature. However, it was clarified that the new amulet doesn't work for EK, and is only useful for blade blast. The speaker is discussing their build in what seems like a video game (possibly an RPG). They made some changes to their equipment and build, such as going full conversion with Grimmsorrow, picking up suppress and other attributes on boots, and adding resist and cast speed on rings. These changes increased the worth of their gear from approximately one divine to seven or eight divines. They also purchased a chest piece with a fractured hybrid that was enhanced with dense fossils. Despite poor suffixes, it later provided good evasion and energy shield, leaving the speaker with a 2k energy shield and high evasion against hit-based attacks.

Additionally, they had initially taken some talents/nodes that provided extra frenzies when they cursed an enemy. This, along with the chest piece that granted frenzies every 15 seconds, allowed them to maintain frenzies almost constantly, except against enemies that could steal charges.

However, they later respecced, moving their points from the frenzy node to Swift Killer for better damage output in endgame situations. They needed to add lining res prior to making a belt swap, which was done through a few tattoos and mana region tattoo. They suggested the possibility of taking more suppress nodes or stun immune nodes since they currently have an overkill. The speaker is discussing the details and strategies of a game character. They're utilizing certain elements like a Watcher's Eye for One Divine which provides Codepen for Hatred and Leech for Vitality. The game character's life is maintained by this Vitality Leech, and the Instant Leech further aids in sustainability. The character is capable of conquering red tier maps comfortably and has a high potential if highly optimized. The effectiveness of the character's single target is reliant on the Blade Blast, the return of which is currently unpredictable. A possible improvement could be the use of an EK Helm Enchant, although acquiring it is challenging. The speaker also mentions using a Void Sphere, which gathers some monsters together. The speaker's character's mana is well sustained. The character discussed is a good starter character with high optimization potentials, referring viewers to look at an Inquisitor built in the last league for more min-max build examples.
