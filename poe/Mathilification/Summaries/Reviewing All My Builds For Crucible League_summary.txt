Samantha discussed different builds she experimented in the "crucible league", totaling 11 games compared to her usual 15 to 20. The games were interrupted by external events such as Diablo 4 and Exile Con. Samantha finds the league pretty cool with increased build variety, impressive gear, and power creep. The Vengeance Cascade was noted as an exciting, yet overpowering addition for projectile builds. Samantha starts with the first of her 11 builds review, the Ice Shot Deadeye which she considers as one of the best starters. Not much had changed with Ice Shot except for the addition of a vile version making it effective for both a single target and Area of Effect (AOE), a feature that sets it apart from the Lightning Arrow. The addition also allows players to see copies of themselves shooting extra ice shots. The text is about a character in a video game in which the Vengeant Cascade ability has been found to be overpowered in most bow and projectile builds. The character first utilized traditional gameplay, but later decided to explore Vengeant Cascade after securing their starter gear. The power of the ability was clear after testing, and it greatly helped their gameplay, even in chaotic scenarios with numerous simultaneous projectiles. The powerful ability allowed the player to cheaply and effectively take on uber bosses. In future gameplay, Avenger Cascade will be replaced with a return proj support. While further details about the new ability are needed, it is suggested that it may be applicable in many projectile builds. Generally, the text highlights the strength of bow builds, which even without additional abilities, are robust for starters. However, it hints that such builds may require specific gear and may not offer substantial defense. It also mentions the character's fondness for the Ice Shot ability. The text discusses a Dead Eye version of Ice Shot as a starter build in a game, rating its effectiveness and enjoyment as 9 out of 10. It can perform all tasks in the game, although it's not the best for single target end tasks. It's described as fun and comfortable to play, with a budget-friendly build that can also be more expensive. The build is equally effective even without Vengeant Cascade. The text mentions a second experimental build involving trigger bots with saboteur, which required more gear and planning. This build was considered not suitable as a starter because it would have been difficult. It became a visual excitement with the use of MTX and tried to use Prismatic Burst for the first time. The extracted information discusses a build that was designed as a hybrid of different elements. The build was meant to function as a spell slinger with two spells, Ice Nova and Glacial Cascade. It had an added Reap with various conversions and Ellie Damage, as well as prismatic burst. The build was activated by casting with a frenzy, causing multiple spells to be released. However, the sheer amount of visuals, including righteous fire, made the situation chaotic and visually confusing. Despite being fun and visually engaging, the build was criticized as having insufficient damage output relative to its vulnerability. This made the build seem "squishy" and did not perform as expected considering the effort and investment made into the build. Although the build was good enough to play and copy, the author mentions better options in terms of trigger bots and examples of prismatic burst. The build was rated as quite effective at clearing and managing boss fights, but the overall assessment was of mixed results - it was enjoyable with great visuals, but didn't provide the expected value for the effort invested. The text discusses two gaming builds. The first build is a spell-triggering type, which is not recommended for individuals on a budget due to the necessity for finely-tuned gear and specific equipment to be effective. The build was ranked as a 5 in terms of budget and is not advisable as a starter.

The second build is a Molten Strike Jug, which was more successful. This build brought back the older Vilepact and Instant Leech, using life gain on hit, numerous projectiles, and hits from Molten Strike. It included stacking Accuracy, Dexterity, and some Intelligence using the new Hand of Thought and Motion Claw, which converted lightning decks into lightning damage. The build also utilized Boots for additional lightning damage via accuracy. This build had a high attack speed and significant lifegain on hit and was able to build as a Jug fairly robustly. The build used new Vengeant Cascade which permitted doubled up balls for the Return Proj as well as the original hit, making it very strong in the current league but might be less effective in the next league. 

The text provides a caution that the Molten Strike Jug build could be less effective without Vengeant Cascade in the next league, although it was highly powerful and enjoyable in the current league. The text describes a strong, resilient build for a game, possibly an RPG, consisting of tanky traits; handling the game's uber bosses and almost every attack. It's mentioned that the build is not particularly expensive but does require a degree of effort to finalize. Many iterations and fine-tuning were needed, with testing done on the passive tree, balancing between INT and DEX attributes. The text notes that Molten Strike was an effective move, even if not the best for clear. The gameplay is said to be decent for clearing with additional strikes from the tree, ancestral call, etc. The build's boss-fighting ability is noted as excellent. The text alludes to a potential challenge presented by the Vengeant Cascade element, yet the build was satisfactory before and will continue to be so afterward, possibly with a slight decrease in effectiveness. In terms of ratings, the build gets a 9 or 10 for effectiveness (depending on priority on mass clear or not), 9 for enjoyment due to its quick attack speed and resiliency, and a yet to be declared score for its budget. The text discusses a game character build, specifically a 'stat stacker', which is initially tough to put together without in-game currency but becomes easier and relatively inexpensive with currency. The build is not suggested as a starter due to its complexity. The character build revolves around the use of a particular jewel and certain pieces of gear. It scored 25, deemed a good score. 

The build also included a 'Crucible concoction', a specific modification tied to classic but now updated game skills known as Exsanguinate and Reap. These skills, especially in their inherent damage over times (dot), were converted into fire under Crucible mod. The combination of both skills provides physical damage over time converted to fire damage over time and an initial decent amount of Ignite hit. The build also includes stacking Golems for generic damage, defense, and regeneration. 

This exact character build will not be reproducible in the same way in the next game league because of the removal of the Crucible mod. However, physical damage over time, along with Exsanguinate and Reap, can still be effectively utilized through an Elementalist, Trickster, or Psion. Ignite may not be the main focus in future setups but could technically be incorporated into an Elementalist's skill set. The character deals physical damage and ignite damage but the value of it is unclear. The character, characterized by exsanguinate, works well when it uses both the chain and damage over time strategy, providing smooth clearing and good area effect potential. The character has good regeneration and sustain but is not very effective in single target battles. To enhance its effectiveness, the character needs to level-up gems and scale damage over time, which can be a difficult task. Other versions of the character use Corrupting Fever for pure Fizz Dot, but achieving a high level requires considerable investment. These builds, Exsanguinate and Reap, are seen as good beginner's choices and are versatile with the Ascendancies but cannot pursue the Fire version like Crucible. The character, although not the best, is quite solid overall and offers a fun gaming experience. From a rating perspective, the character achieves a score of 9 for effective clearing and decent bossing. The gameplay experience is also rated as highly enjoyable, except for the inconvenience caused by the death of the golems, especially during the simulacrum, which is a particularly challenging environment for golems and elementalists. The text discusses a budget build for a gaming character. The build described includes lots of plus ones, fine-tuned gear and a specific Crucible mod and a plus four corrupted chest, which are inexpensive but hard to acquire. The writer also sought good megalomaniacs, which aren't common choices. The budget for the build isn't excessive, but copying the character would be almost impossible due to the detailed setup. This specific version isn't suitable for beginners. They mentioned a previous build using a Crucible Staff with built-in links found through shopping. The writer also comments on a unique combo of Immolate, Arcane Surge, and Ice Bite discovered for making a brand character, and acknowledges the recent revamp of Arcane Surge Hierophant nodes which was successful with a non-totem character. The text references the constant goodness of Storm Brand over the years.
 The text discusses the versatility of the Storm Brand in the game, which can be built in various ways including Void Batteries, Arc Mage, and Annihilating Light. The Hierophant example highlighted its strength, indicating good mapping using lightning warp and making it potentially a speedy character. Storm Brand was noted for its use in bossing due to its ability to apply continuous damage while moving around, contrasting to some melee builds where damage application is limited. The character using Storm Brand took on all uber bosses, it wasn't expensive to make but had unique items, making it somewhat challenging to replicate but easy to pivot into a different build style while maintaining effectiveness. Despite the character's less robust build due to using Storm Brand, the play style allows for continuous movement reducing chances of being hit. Additionally, remark was made on the Uberserious fight which was difficult and one of the rare instances the character died. The final assessment of the character built using Storm Brand was a rating of 10 in terms of effectiveness. The document is a review of a Stormbrand character game. The reviewer found that the game garners high enjoyment, awarding it a 9 due to its clear and bossing capabilities, as well as playstyle. The game is not vastly different from the standard Stormbrand game - it's just another character of the same type with limited room for innovation. 

The budget for the specific version under review is adequate. Costly items such as the staff in the game can be replicated at a small cost. This character variant uses triple elemental damage, deviating from the traditional one or two elements used in a Stormbrand. The cost-effectiveness and feasibility granted a score of 27 out of some undisclosed higher score. 

Although this specific version might not be easy to start with, especially concerning obtaining the staff, it's still generally starter-viable. It can be adapted to an alternate template or can be played as an inquisitor. 

The text also describes the next build as a visual glorious mess mainly because of a feature that creates massive lightning zaps from the sky. The reviewer found it slightly blinding but still enjoyed playing and looking at the game. It's mentioned that it was supposed to be a big meme attempt featuring Mjolnir Sion Doryani prototype using Absolution but without the minion portion of it, only the actual. The main topic is a game character build, focusing on converting physical damage to lightning and reducing enemies' lightning resistance by 180 through a specific chest piece. The user compensated for their own reduced lightning resistance using the Eyes of the Great Wolf, which transformed all lightning damage to fire damage. The character's fire and cold resistances were maximized at 90 using Melding of Flesh, resulting in a robust character with high resistance. This build is distinguishably strong, efficient at mapping, and capable of defeating bosses, including ubers. The character's single-target damage, though not the highest, was satisfactory with an estimated DPS of 20-30 million. The build process is described as challenging, requiring strategic gear selection and a keen balance of stat ranges, resistances, and critical hit enhancements. The final character is visually impressive and notably solid in boss fights, although there are issues with the melee playstyle linked to the use of Cyclone compared to Storm brand. The text discusses a Doryani's build, which has good recovery and defenses but is susceptible to certain forms of lightning damage, specifically, damage over time. It is considered a tough build to recreate, with unique attributes. The effectiveness of the build is high owing to Dorian's prototype, except for a vulnerability to lightning damage. The build is also deemed enjoyable, with cyclone spells and Mjolnir enhancing the fun of the game play.

Regarding the budget involved, the build includes certain components, such as Mjolnir, fire res, and a devouring diadem. The Dorian's prototype is employed with advanced gear like Eyes of The Great Wolf, which was acquired economically due to a fortuitous listing by another player. Other elements include Forbidden Fleshes, Thread of Hopes, and Melting of Flesh. The process of creation was challenging but reportedly worth the effort. The text discusses two different builds in a game. The first build is not specified, but notes suggest it's neither the most expensive nor the most challenging, and it is given a rating of one in some unspecified metric. It's also indicated to be unsuitable for beginners. The second build, referred to as the "build of the league", was a result of combining aspects of various game features (specifically, Volcanic Fisher, Replica Albarons, Vengeant Cascade, and Poison Scaling). The build was marked by high poison damage and ramp, good sustain through life gain on hit, projectile overlap resulting from combining Vengeant Cascade and Volcanic Fissure, and focus on defenses. The character was a Pathfinder type, had near-infinite flasks, high armour evasion, and a Berserk feature for panic situations and extra damage reduction. The user also utilized a special tool called Crucible Axe. Despite being powerful, it might be difficult to replicate due to the need for the tool Replica Alborons. The text discusses a particular build in a game, specifically focusing on the Volcanic Fissure, Vengeant Cascade, and Replica Alborons. The build, possibly in an RPG or MMORPG, gained status as "build of the league", indicating it was considered a strong and popular choice. The skill Volcanic Fissure can be both melee and ranged, offering versatility for different play styles. Although it's noted that the upcoming league may change the effectiveness of Vengeant Cascade, the overall performance of the build is not expected to be impacted significantly. It's praised for its high effectiveness, good clear-rate, poison proliferation, range potential, and sustainability. Despite being expensive, particularly due to the inclusion of Replica Alborons, the build is considered enjoyable to play. The build is also described as strength stack, implying a focus on increasing a particular stat - strength. Lastly, it's mentioned that developing the build, particularly in relation to the crucible tree, can be challenging. The text discusses two game builds. The first build is referred to as a 'league.' It features a 'volcanic fissure,' which initially starts slow but can be powerful and enjoyable once it is geared towards speed. Despite its strengths, the build cannot be easily started, making it unsuitable for beginners. 

The second build was described as highly experimental and was characterized by the use of the elemental hit as melee with a staff, specifically the Annihilating Light triple damage staff. This particular build's major challenge centered around the lack of attack speed inherent in the Annihilating Light staff, which was surpassed by leveraging the Crucible for extra attack speed, and additional attack speed was achieved by scaling as a champion with Ace. The build deals damage using all three elements and its playstyle is likened to basic strike skill action. Despite the challenge presented by the slow staff based playstyle, the text suggests that the finalized version of this build was decent. The text discusses a melee elemental hit staff-based champion in a game. This character was fairly stable, highlighted by good defenses and decent clear, but ultimately needed more damage to be highly effective. Despite being a strike skill, the character could deliver some good clear with additional strikes like Ancestral Call and other similar skills. However, when the character was pushed to its limits, it lacked the desired single-target damage and did not perform well in Ubers. An ideal melee uber character would need about 15 to 30 million damage, much higher than the 8 million DPS this character could put out. The character had some unique aspects and required a meticulous approach to assemble, which was described as fun yet slightly challenging. On a scale of effectiveness and enjoyment, the character was rated a seven for both aspects; it had manageable clear and single target skills but offered nothing outstanding. The character was described as fairly durable and while it was enjoyable to put together, its performance was merely satisfactory. 1. The speaker has created a character concept in a game with a moderate budget and finds it is not super well-budgeted, potentially rated as four out of a given scale.
2. This character is not considered ideal as a first character or 'starter' due to its weaknesses in a melee role, specifically with less effective damage (le hit). It is suggested that it might be suitable as a 'berserker' or 'slayer' role.
3. The character design is viewed as a good idea and a 'proof of concept', despite receiving a generally low score.
4. The speaker then discusses a second build, centered on utilizing a 'crucible modifier', enabling the character abilities 'venom gyre' and 'cobra lash' to cause physical and bleeding damage, rather than chaos damage.
5. The strategy involves using a slow claw, and stacking many bleeds with the crimson darts, aiming to have good speed and extensive area damage with venom 'dryer'. Bleeds are highlighted as a consistent source of damage.
6. The design enables the character to maintain a safe distance, not requiring close-range melee to inflict damage.
7. The character is also designed to be thick, specifically utilizing a 'gladiator' variant with 'max block' and 'spell suppress' capped for defense.
8. The character is noted to have done most 'uber bosses', with around 5 million consistent bleed damage along with potential additional corrupting fever damage.
9. Overall, while specific, the speaker states that more details about this build aren't necessary to mention. The text discusses a character build in a game, presumably a role-playing game. This build is a Crucible mod, which, according to the text, cannot be made anymore. An alternative build identified is the Spectral Shield Throw build, a reliable one that has been in use for a long time.

The character build under discussion featured Venom Jaya turned into a bleed build, used for uber boss damage. It was considered a unique build but the author expressed desire for more damage capability. Despite its limitations, the enjoyment level was high, rated a 9, indicating a fun gameplay experience.

Rating wise, the character build was given an 8 for effectiveness; it had a clear decent enough single target around 5 million despite some hard cap limitations inherent to the bleed build.

The budget needed to put the build together wasn't overly expensive. Most gear slots are flexible, but there was a focus on Corrupting Fever and Venom Gyre which contributed to the build's damage capabilities. The cost of creating this character is estimated at three or four units of the game's currency. 

However, this build was not recommended as a starter for new players. Another alternative, Bleed Glad, within a shield Spectral Shield throw environment could be a starter but is unrelated to the main build being discussed. The text describes a strategy in a game. The author chose to use the Bleed Glad build even after considering that Gladiator is overdue for a rework, achieving a 21 rating. The highlight was a new build that was selected as the most decisive build of the game's league. This was the Ethereal Knives with Blade Blast build employed as an Inquisitor.

The author utilised Nimmy's Ring for the first time in this build, which reroutes projectiles randomly and concludes in their return to the player. Although uncommon and expensive, its use was justified as Vengeant Cascade significantly diminished its value, leading to its acquisition.  

The combination of Ethereal Knives with Nimmy's Ring caused a beneficial effect where projectiles left by Ethereal Knives compile at the player's feet. This interaction enabled the effective use of Blade Blast with Ethereal Knives for the first time. Usually, using Ethereal Knives throws blades randomly, making Blade Blast ineffective. 

With this setup, Ethereal Knives became a pure clear tool that offers notable damage and allows the use of Blade Blast as a potent single-target tool. The challenge is that the player needs to play more like a melee character. The subject of the text is a game character build featuring the Blade Blast ability, which was used more as an afterthought but still proved to be a cool concept. A new returning projectile support gem, expected in an upcoming gaming league event, makes this build even more effective, allowing for ethereum knives returning projectiles and Blade Blast. Furthermore, Nimis equipment could enhance this build. However, if Nimis is not affordable or available, the returning projectile function should be sufficient. The build demonstrated impressive damage with the ethereum knives and Blade Blast, and it had an excellent single target ability. An uber footage option could also be activated for extra single target damage, or a significant amount of sustain via energy shield and life regen could be prioritised instead. This build is largely based on cold damage which helps in freezing enemies, thus leading to an effective defense mechanism. The Maven, Cirrus, and most uber character builds could not withstand the damage from this build and were easily defeated. Overall, the build has been described as one of the best for dealing with single targets.
 The text discusses a unique and relatively inexpensive gaming concept that the speaker enjoyed and found effective. While not the most affordable, the cost-to-effectiveness rating was high. The speaker had put some effort into refining the character's gear, making it better than average but not unrealistic—likely attainable early in the League. The speaker mentioned steeling "Harmony of Purpose" from the Guardian. However, this may not an option in the future, necessitating alternate strategies. The speaker deemed the concept a potential starter and was considering it for personal use. The speaker also mentioned previous experience playing Path of Exile (POE) religiously for the past 10 years. This concept incorporates the use of Blade Blast and focuses on a single target, increasing its viability as a starter. However, the speaker is uncertain about its viability with Inquisitor. An additional build was mentioned at the end, the last one from the League, concerning a video the speaker recently made after a two-month break from playing POE. The player tried a new character build in the game Path of Exile, using IceNova and Frostbolt in a bow cast on crit format, and utilizing the Triggerbot setup from the Saboteur class. The build was visually intensive due to the high action of IceNovas and Frostbolts. The player found the build moderately successful, with good clearing ability, decent single-target damage, and moderate survivability due to evasion, spell suppression, and Saboteur's blind node. However, the build was not considered very powerful. Although this new experience was somewhat successful, the player suggested there are more powerful bow cast on crit setups that they have tried in the past, namely builds with Detonate Dead, Blade Blast, and Inquisitor's volt tactic. The player used this build as a stepping stone to return to the game after a period of absence. Despite its uniqueness, the player doesn't highly recommend this build. The speaker experimented with the Crucible League game and completed challenges. The game's effectiveness was approximately a score of 7. The speaker's character had good clear, but its boss damage was below average. The game, despite being blinding and occasionally frustrating due to visibility issues, was enjoyable. However, it wasn't recommended for newbies due to the investment required, including gear and very specific stuff like the bow cast on crit. The speaker warned against using cast on crit as a starting character unless the player has advanced knowledge of the game dynamics, as it requires a transition from a spell-based character to a cast-on-crit mode at approximately level 80. The Crucible League was overall rewarding and featured various unique, ingenuous builds made possible by additional modifiers, even though the speaker didn't get around to trying 5-10 builds due to commitments to playing Diablo 4. However, the Crucible League was criticized in the wider community and streaming it wasn't entirely comfortable due to the negative surroundings. The league was positively noted for its versatility, despite the tedious mechanics and imbalance in monster level. The speaker is expressing hope for the success of a forthcoming league, potentially similar to a sanctum. They have provided content for the recent crucible league, and they believe their work with builds has been notably good. They also express gratitude towards their audience for their engagement and plans to continue providing content.
