The text talks about a build for a gaming league by a player named Mathal, who played Theron Ives to set up his Atlas. Mathal wanted to play with one of the new supporter gems, particularly Spellblade. This gem grants Battlemage in a support format, enabling players not only Inquisitor or Templars to use weapons for spell casting purposes including weapons with elemental, physical, or even chaos damage. The Spellblade can transform any attack-based damage into spell damage. In this character, Mathal plans to convert Energy Blade's damage into spell damage. Energy Blade is a buff that cuts a player's energy and energy shield in half and gives them a weapon with lightning damage. It can be stacked with Battle Mage to produce very high amounts of Energy Blade. Using this, the character gains 4,000 lightning damage for spells. Furthermore, combining Battle Mage and Spell Blade results in increased effects from Energy Blade. Specifically, Spell Blade provides approximately 130% more effects but occupies a support gem slot. This strategy is part of a build aiming to use arc totems with the aforementioned setup. Additionally, Mathal is intending to use arc due to its potentially interesting interaction with the league mechanic and the fact that he hasn't played a totem character for a while. The text discusses the performance of the Arc Totem league mechanic in a game, comparing it with other totem setups. While it's good for league mechanics, it tends to be underpowered when compared to other totem setups which is why there aren't many arc totems. However, the writer is attempting to improve this with an Energy Blade spell blade battle mage setup that has performed well on a low budget. A few divines have been invested in this build and the character is engaging in tier 10 maps comfortably.

The setup includes an Inquisitor character using a similar build to an Energy Blade character the player has previously built, focusing on adding strength and intelligence points for extra critical hits, life, and Energy Shield. The text also mentions a challenge where the player has to achieve a 200+ rank by themselves. Despite the challenging conditions, the totems proved to be an efficient setup.

However, it is mentioned that other totem setups may yield better results, with specific reference to stormburst totems, divine ire totems and shockwave totems, the latter gaining special recognition for its efficiency and long-range capabilities. The text discusses the building and playing of a character in an unspecified game. The player's character is built using a Ghost Wrath instead of an Ivory Tower, making it less expensive. While the character lacks good recovery and strong defenses, it has a buffer of extra energy shield and life. Gameplay requires strategic placement and avoiding damage as the character cannot endure heavy hits. The character, named Tootle, is a level 87 Inquisitor and is based on a turtle theme fitting within the game's league mechanic. Different routes can be taken when developing the character, such as stealing instruments of virtue for additional features like battle mage or spellblade. In this case, the player has opted for a basic route, without any stolen ascendancies to remain cost-effective. The character has an energy blade attribute; its weapon is derived from the energy blade buff determined by the character's energy shield. The energy blade cuts the energy shield in half and converts it into lightning damage. This approach, though complex and resource-consuming, imbues the character with lightning damage capabilities. The text discusses the strategy and mechanics of utilizing energy shield, spellblade, battle mage, and totem setup in a game. Energy shield serves as a defensive mechanism, increasing the character's resistance to damage. Spellblade and battle mage synergistically increase damage, specifically lightning damage, when used together with a weapon. Using the energy blade and battle mage can substantially increase a character's damage range. An energy blade can enhance arc, a type of attack, increasing its damage from 700-4,000 to 1,900-27,000. A build could be either arc or Inquisitor, allowing use of any spell, based on strategy preference. The writer shares their successful personal strategy of using totems with arc. They mention incorporating totem setup can be challenging due to the lack of immediate placement speed and an extra third totem compared to a Hierophant totem. Regardless, a successful setup can result in smooth leveling with a powerful battle mage setup. The narration is about a game character build, specifically focusing on improving its Energy Shield through the Ghost Wrath feature. With Ghost Wrath, half of the game character's life is converted into Energy Shield. Without this feature, the character has 2,800 Energy Shield and 5,400 life. But when Ghost Wrath is activated, while the character's life gets halved, its Energy Shield goes up to 9,000.  

The speaker also discusses utilising systems like the Energy Blade feature and building around a past character model called Cast on Crit, Aya Winter, which was an Inquisitor using this strategy a couple of leagues ago. Here, the premise was to stack Strength and Intellect, providing increased energy shield and life. Being an Inquisitor, the character benefits from multipliers on critical hits. 

The most expensive item in the setup is the 'crown of the inward eye' with an additional arc, costing two divines. This item gives enhancements in many areas: armor, energy shield, life, mana and damage scalings. The author mentions that the enchantment related to the item isn't super important but does contribute to extra damage. The speaker talks about a game character setup. They have an additional totem shield and crafted a belt with strength and intelligence. They acquired high templar gloves that include cast speed and spell critical hit for the cost of 100 C. The gloves also have an extra feature of having +1 gems which is optimal for inserting an Enlighten. Other alternatives to these gloves are Eldritch Implicit gloves. Meanwhile, a Shaper Glove that comes with Car Speed also fits the game character.

No Jewels Sockets have been used so far but there is a plan to use them in the future. Possibilities include obtaining a good Watcher's Eye or conventional jewels that carry Car Speed and Crit Multi.

The gameplay video includes the usage of a five-link setup. The five-link consists of Spelltotem, Multitotem, Spellblade, Arc, and Crit Damage. The Spellblade variant used in the five-link is Divergent which provides a 10% Lucky Hit. Prior to achieving a satisfactory Crit level, Crit Strikes was used instead of Crit Damage.

Other than the five-link setup, support skills including Purity of Elements, Discipline, Vitality, Defiance Banner, and Clarity are mentioned. If the character adopts a low-life approach, the speaker reminds to maintain a high Chaos Resistance and constant life regeneration from Vitality.

The speaker admits that the character setup is not fully optimized for endgame and there's still score for improvements. They hint at the potential of this character setup. Moreover, the possibility of fitting an Abyssal Jewel on Energy Blade is also mentioned, which could be done before transforming a weapon into an Energy Blade. The speaker mentions a task related to a jewel and craft activity that is expected to be completed in the future. They deem their current progress as relatively basic. They also express hopes in producing a bigger video about the endgame and other related topics soon, if things go according to plan. Moreover, they express gratitude to their audience for watching, indicating they have produced a video, which involves a character content that the audience is supposedly fond of. They signal the end of their dialogue by bidding the audience farewell, with the anticipation of the next encounter.
