Summarized Chunk 1:
The text discusses the role of Logan Ury, the Director of Relationship Science at Hinge. In Ury's role, she works with a team of researchers to explore different aspects of dating habits and how they impact relationships. They have performed studies around topics such as mental health in dating, revealing that 86% of people prioritize mental health in relationships and even prefer dating people who go to therapy. She and her team also investigated the trend of Gen Z constantly seeking advice from their friends about dating, encouraging this generation to rely on their own feelings instead. Ury highlighted the effect of ever-present digital surveillance on dating behavior, creating a sense of paranoia that inhibits people's natural behaviors.

 secondly, the filter of is this okay for me to say, oh, maybe it's not, I've got to think about it. And that's not a very sort of easy, graceful way to be. So what would you say? Well, how would you categorize the sort of messaging that young people are being given around what love and dating and romance is supposed to be in 2022? Yeah, it's something that I'm actively thinking about, I would say 2022 is a year where I have spent way more time thinking about the Gen Z audience. And so I would say, as of now, I'm probably a millennial dating expert. So that means that I've worked with loads of millennial clients. A lot of hinge users are millennials. So the research and the data I've had access to for two years is based on that. And now it's like, of course, like what happens with generations? Like people age into the dating market. And so I need to spend way more time understanding that. And as silly as it sounds, I just binge watched both seasons of euphoria. I haven't watched that. What's that? Okay. It's like a really amazing slash raunchy show on HBO. It's about a teen dealing with drug addiction. There's a lot of sex. There's a lot of nudity, but it's also just kind of about the like overstimulating anxious Gen Z high school experience. And like, who knows how realistic or not that is. I certainly don't think the clothes are realistic, but it is interesting to think about like, what does Gen Z know about dating? So there are some things that are like clear trends. So of course the world is moving in a more fluid direction and so that means things like gender identity, gender orientation, sexual orientation. And so if you think about that applied to dating, you're not necessarily looking for the one or you're not necessarily as focused on this outcome of like I'm going to get married, I'm going to be married to one person and I hope it lasts as long as possible. Maybe you're into non-monogamy. Maybe you're into having a relationship that's really powerful but you're not focused on marriage or maybe you don't even want to have kids. Maybe climate change has made you so afraid of the future that like having kids sounds preposterous to you. And so it's really interesting to think about what are the cultural forces affecting Gen Z and then how does that show up in their dating. That being said, I do think that we all really do have this natural desire to love and be loved and so I don't care what's happening on YouTube. I don't care how many tick tocks there are about certain trends at the end of the day Love and dating and finding someone or someones I still think is very relevant to people Well, yeah human biology is a hell of a drug and you're gonna have to work incredibly hard to like front brain out Yeah, millions of years of evolution that compels you to behave in one way. I think I I've never felt so much like a boomer as I have recently. I'm a millennial as well You know like slap bang in the middle of it. No Great for a boomer but I've never felt so out of touch and it's crazy to look at you know Remember, it wasn't that long ago that Millennials was sort of the the media's common calling card They were the ones that everybody was pitching on and and now I'm being looked at and thinking about you know Stuff to do with gender fluidity stuff to do with non-monogamy being not just for certain friends of mine in Austin But you know as a general scalable Opportunity and I'm like this just it doesn't resonate with me, it doesn't resonate with my friends, and I now am starting to get a sense of what it must have felt like for my parents' generation, looking down at my generation, just getting into Facebook and online dating and dick pics and stuff like that, to then roll that forward. So I guess each new generation can make the older generation feel more boomery than they ever thought they could. Totally. And I feel the exact same way, where I'm like, wait, it feels like two years ago, there was an article about millennials are killing dining room furniture, millennials are killing the paper napkin. It was all about how millennials were changing things. I have a friend who is known as the millennial workplace expert, and then boom, now all we're talking about is Gen Z. And I find that so fascinating. And are you a fan of Bo Burnham? Yes. I've only seen a little bit of his work, but yes, he's good. Okay. So I'm a massive Bo Burnham fan, and he has that amazing special that came out last year called Inside, and there's a song on it. I play the song. on repaint, but there's a song that's basically like he was born in 1990 and he was always known as the young guy and he was always like, Oh, I can't believe you've accomplished this by that age. And then the song about turning 30, he's like, now the zoomers are telling me that I'm out of touch. And so you're really like through these very funny lyrics, hearing about his existential crisis about being like the young, hip, cool guy, pushing the edges where very few people are going to be like, I can't believe you accomplished that by 30 because it's like 30 is not considered. It's supposed to have you shit together. Yeah. I had this conversation not long ago that just getting no longer being young is a strange thing. So I'm 34 and pretty much every single year, probably up until 31 or 32, everything biologically was just improving. So I was getting better looking, I was becoming more confident, I was recovering from workouts in the gym better. I had more muscle mass. I could get leaner. I all that stuff, right? And then you just sort of. you know when you're at the top of a roller coaster and it's been going up and then you start to feel yourself go weightless and you go oh hold on hang on a second hang on this is i know what happens next this is just before it starts to go down and that's something that i'm grappling with at the moment the fact that you know my gym workouts are going to get progressively more difficult for me to recover from moving forward that looking good is going to become progressively more difficult moving forward now i think there's a good argument to be made here for both guys and girls that if you have made it into your 30s and your primary source of value that you see in yourself to the world is the way that you look there's probably something that goes wrong there because you can have wisdom that's just going to compound over time grace empathy love poise you know confidence all that stuff all of that shit can continue to grow um but there is something a bit sort of like oh is the ride over like that kind of totally when did that change happen for you probably 31 32 um so probably during the pandemic was just after that, within the last sort of 18 months to two years. But again, I don't know how much of that's just been due to the fact that I've been locked in the house. You know, maybe I'm going to have a fourth puberty or something next year, and I'm going to shoot up again. But I think for a good few of my friends as well, it seems to be the same case. We're just finding stuff that used to be easy and not getting over hangovers. That's been impossible for 10 years. Some things that used to be easier, just aren't the same anymore. I think that I mean, it all really resonates with me. I'm also 34. And I feel like I'm less in touch with my body and my health, as compared to my husband. But my husband is one of those people where it's like, he's he read that book, how how not to die. And he is, you know, he's always intermittent fasting. And he's thinking about like, how his cells can age backwards. And I'm like, dude, I just want to feel good when I wake up in the morning. Like, I just want to feel physically better. He's like planning for the future. So I do think it depends on how tuned in to our own bodies we all are. Well, here's an interesting thing. Civilization on average has never been this old. And on average, we've never had so long to live. Yeah. That's so wild. That blows my mind. The fact that we're the oldest civilization in history that's going to live the longest. Oh, yeah. Well, that also is relevant to relationships because if you're choosing a partner for a decade for a few decades versus many, many, many decades, like what does that mean? Half a century. Yeah, exactly. And how does that change your expectations? I even have friends who are Mormon and are like, you're choosing that person for forever. And I'm like, oh my God, I can't even fathom that amount of pressure that you're choosing a relationship for all of eternity. Yeah, bro, that literally could be 70 years from the time that you're 20. Someone goes away, does their mission, comes back and you're like, okay. So my assistant, Ben, he's Mormon. And he's 22, 22, 23. And him and his missus are married. And they're amazing. but I'm like, fuck, man, like that could be, you could be talking about 70 years of marriage from this point. And this isn't- Plus eternity for that. Oh, and the rest, yeah, obviously. For eternity, don't underestimate that. That's more than 70 years. Don't underestimate eternity, yeah, that's a good lesson. So what is it, I've been thinking about this a lot. I've had a lot of conversations on the show to do with dating, intersexual dynamics, the mating market, imbalances, stuff like that. One of the things that keeps coming up is kind of a bit of an ick factor that some people have around anybody that has an intentional approach toward designing a lifestyle around dating. Why do you think that is? Okay, I couldn't think that that was funnier because I'm literally drinking from a mug that says intentionally ever after, which is the last line of my book. It's about, you know, forget happily ever after and go for intentionally ever after. And so I'm really like ready to put my boxing gloves on and fight this one because like this is my entire ethos. This is my perspective and. My viewpoint is that the type of clients that I work with, the
--------------------------------------------------Summarized Chunk 2:
The text discusses how the perspective on love, dating, and romance has changed in the year 2022, specifically in regards to a younger, Gen Z audience. The speaker identifies themselves as a millennial dating expert and has worked with many millennial clients, particularly users of the dating app 'Hinge'. However, they feel a growing need to understand the Gen Z perspective as they age into the dating market.

One observation is that society is moving towards more fluid concepts of gender identity, sexual orientation, and relationship structure. Not all individuals are seeking "the one" or focused on marriage, and non-monogamous relationships or not having children due to concerns such as climate change are more common. The speaker stresses that despite societal shifts, the desire to love and be loved remains a constant, regardless of generation.

The speaker also mentions feeling out-of-touch due to rapid generational changes and the rise of Gen Z influence, comparing it to the feeling their parents might have had when they were getting into Facebook, online dating, and other practices. This highlights the cultural gap between different generations.

The speaker also discusses growing older and the changes that come with it. At the age of 34, they note a decrease in physical abilities and recovery. However, they emphasize the importance of wisdom, empathy, grace, and confidence as attributes that can grow with age. They also contemplate the concept of choosing a life partner, considering factors such as the increasing lifespan of humans.

Lastly, the speaker challenges the perceived 'ick' factor of having an intentional approach to designing a lifestyle around dating, which they believe to be their mission and perspective as a dating expert.

 people who are drawn to my work, which is not for everyone, it's for his type of person. It's the person who says, um, if I want to be healthy, then I might listen to Tim Ferris or I might be interested in Bulletproof coffee. I would listen to these podcasts and take these supplements. If I wanted to get better at personal finances, then I would listen to Ramit Sethi. Like there's just like a self-help world. And so like we believe in, we, these people, including myself, believe in like lifestyle design and saying like, when you have a goal, you should go after it. You should have people who are experts. You should understand the blind spots. You should understand what makes it hard and then make a plan. And somehow love feels like it's on this other dimension where we're not allowed to do that. And people put love on a special platform and they won't allow it to be researched or analyzed. And they think that it makes it unromantic. My entire philosophy is that yes, love is natural, love is organic, you are born knowing how to love, but you are not born knowing how to date. And dating as we know it is extremely new in the span of human history. So even the idea of people on their own choosing each other, that happened in around 1890 and there's a great book on this called The Labor of Love by Maura Weigel. Since then, obviously, gender dynamics have changed, women being out of the house, in the workplace, like this idea of the shop girl in the 1920s, you know, meeting a guy. But even then it was like, oh, I'm going to go on a date so I can have a hot meal because I can't afford one otherwise. And then you think online dating started around 94, 95 with Match Group and Kiss.com. Then the dating apps only started a decade ago. So you were talking about human biology is a hell of a drug, well, you know, evolutionarily we are not designed to choose from thousands of potential options and either, even and choose for ourselves. The historical reference is that marriage was an economic institution where maybe my father would give your father 12 camels for my hand in marriage and if my land was next to your land, we could combine the two through marriage. And so the idea of people- I'd take 12 camels for you, Logan. Okay, thank you so much. That's fine. Flattered. The idea that people would be marrying for love, the idea that people would be marrying for 70 years, the idea that people would be marrying for self-actualization, that's all so new. And so I think that ick factor is people responding to this idea that they want love and dating to be a realm that cannot be analyzed when actually I'm like, hey, this is one of the most important decisions you will make in your life. Who your partner is, that is your number one teammate, that is your number one giver of advice. This is your counsel. And why would you not try to take what this amazing field of relationship science has learned about long-term relationships? attraction, what the field of behavioral science has learned about common biases and how we make mistakes in decision making. Why wouldn't you take all that and then be informed to make the right decision? Just like you'd think about personal finance, accounting, nutrition, fitness, etc. This is a science and it can be analyzed and I think the ick factor is misplaced. I think a lot of people see romance as a black box, that there is something magical about it. There's a term called conceptual inertia, which I learned about from a history of science researcher, which is that when new insights from science arrive, a lot of the time it takes time for culture to then catch up. So if you went from Earth being the center of the universe to the Earth revolving around the Sun revolving around the galaxy, that switch in terms of models was accepted by science but only 50 years, 75 years later was sort of permeated the culture so that people actually started to think and feel like that. So you have this sort of lagging measure. of what people think, despite the fact that they may have had something proven in front of them. And I think that insights from evolutionary psychology, from relationship science, all this stuff, takes time to trickle down, and what you're battling against is still a lot of culture, Disneyfication of movies, your Love Actually's, your rom-coms, that kind of... I mean, is relationship science romantic? It's certainly not romantic in the traditional way. So it's very rare that you're going to have, here's a movie about a girl who optimized her online dating profile, and after she'd done that, then she decided to go on 37 dates and then pick the next best person that was there after that, because she'd read Algorithms to Live By, and you go, that's just not gonna be a movie. So a lot of the time, with regards to relationships presented in common media, you don't have what's optimal being what's shown. You have this idealized, much more naturalistic way, so I do think there's a tension between those two. you. Everything you just said, I agree with, and I think you really nailed the problem. And then I can present my approach, which is slightly different. And I think the cultural inertia thing, is that what it's called? Cultural inertia? Yeah, that makes total sense to me. I mean, even if I'm thinking about like climate change and don't look up and like, why is it so hard for, you know, everyone is paying attention to this thing in pop culture versus what's happening with climate change. And it's like, why are we not paying attention to the science? And I don't know. But yes, in my world, I would say, first of all, what do I think is romantic? What I think is romantic is waking up in bed with my husband after we've been together for seven years, and just being excited to talk, feeling like your partner is your best friend, and it's you against the world. Like still being excited to have sex and have dinner with someone who you've known for a long time, and there is no chase, because essentially, you are a team, and there is such a foundation of trust. Romance to me is the experience I had over the last two years with my husband Which is he was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer He went through 18 rounds of chemotherapy below the knee ampute leg amputation Crazy shit that you do not expect in year one of marriage and saying I fucking love you. I'm here for you. I You are much more than your body to me You are much more than your health to me and just being like I'm all in like to me That is the essence of romance. I don't think romance is Oh He planned the state where he picked me up in an uber black and took me to a cool Expensive sushi restaurant like I don't care like that is courtship courtship is lovely flirting is lovely feeling a connection with someone is lovely But to me the real romance is the deep connection and trust that you maintain over time So people who are resisting this they're basically saying when you apply science to love You are taking us out of the black box You are taking us away from the mystery and you are really focusing on the practical but life is the practical. Life is doing your taxes. Life is wiping your baby's diaper like that's what life is like. It's not the trip to Hawaii. It's not those moments because yes those are peak moments but most of life is the average moment where you and this person are saying I'm your partner and I'm all in and let's do this together. And so yes Disney movies are the way they are. Rom-coms are the way they are. I like the show Bridgerton but like what I'm really doing what my role in the universe is right now is to help people find a long term partner that is going to help them create a great life. It's not about the reality TV show sparky in the moment feeling because that fades and I'm really here for the long term relationships. I wonder how much of the black box mentality is also because if people believe that. there is a effective strategy to be able to date, that makes them more culpable for their dating failures. Like if it hasn't gone well, and it's a black box, then there was nothing that I could have done about it. But if it hasn't gone well, and it's because I wasn't sufficiently well educated or informed, or maybe I messed up, then it's not to do with the magic of Cupid, it's to do with me not knowing enough. That's a very hot take. And I think that's clever, and I will think about it more. But my gut reaction is that people already feel that way. And so I have a chapter in my book called why dating is harder now than ever before. One of the elements of that is that in the past, if your love was negotiated, not your love, your marriage was negotiated for you by your father, by the matchmaker, and camels, can't forget the camels, then everything was really written for you, right? We inherited these identities. So for me, if I had been born 200 years before, let's say I would have been a Jewish woman living in Berlin who knew. Exactly how I spent my time my marriage would have been negotiated for me by the local matchmaker I would have known what I ate what I wore how I spent Shabbat how I raised my children everything would have been predetermined for me and part of modern life is freedom But that freedom is scary because when you write your own story if that story sucks You are the only one to blame and I think that is the ethos of our modern era And so I already think that people think I haven't found love. It's on me I don't think that you know as much as people like romance. I don't think that they imagine Cupid just missed his arrow I really think that if you saw the emails that I get you'd know people are being extremely hard on themselves And they are taking their lack of success and love as a personal failure. So we're already there How can people learn to be happy with their decisions then? Getting into and getting out of relationships and all of the things they're in Without it being about a single Incident
--------------------------------------------------Summarized Chunk 3:
The text primarily focuses on the modern understanding and approach towards love, dating, and relationships. The writer opines that there is a cultural trend to romanticize love as a concept that cannot be analyzed or understood scientifically. Nonetheless, they argue that love should be looked at from a logical perspective, especially since dating is a relatively modern concept, with the author highlighting changes in gender dynamics and the advent of online dating. The writer advocates for the use of science in understanding love and building successful relationships. 

They emphasize that while love might be natural and organic, dating isn't, and people aren't born with an innate understanding of it. The author references a book called "The Labor of Love" by Maura Weigel, which discusses this evolution. 

They also mention the impact of media on people's perception of love and relationships, often portraying an idealized, naturalistic approach that could be further from the actual reality of making relationships work. The author distinguishes courtship and flirting from the essence of romance, which they believe lies in the deep connection and trust that is maintained over time.

The writer also expresses the notion that people's reluctance to adopt a scientific understanding of love could be due to fear of culpability for their dating failures. However, they observe that individuals already take personal responsibility for their lack of success in love. The writer advocates for people to learn to be content with their decisions related to relationships, highlighting that the focus should be on building long-term, committed relationships rather than on the fleeting feelings often portrayed in media.
--------------------------------------------------Original Chunk 4:
 what is an overarching way? to make better decisions or to be happier with your decisions? Yeah. So we talked about how I have this intentionally ever after mug, and I really do believe in this intentional approach to love. And so what that might look like, and there's a whole menu of things and people can pick and choose what works for them, but a lot of it is just owning your past behavior. And so in my class, Date Smarter, we do this activity called the relationship audit and people have a lot of resistance to it. They don't necessarily enjoy it, but you basically say, who are the people I've dated? Why did it end? What was good about this relationship? What was bad? What side of me did they bring out? You know, if they understand attachment theory, then was that person anxious or avoidant or secure? So really saying, what's gone on in my past? And then looking at your patterns and saying, wow, I tend to meet more people in person. Maybe the dating apps aren't a good fit for me. That's a takeaway. Or I tend to like someone until they like me back and then I don't trust them. and I run away, or my version of love is chasing after someone. And so a lot of it is understanding what's your past behavior and how can you make different choices in the future. Then there's understanding what matters and what doesn't for long-term relationship success. And so some of the things that matter less than people think they do are things like looks and money. Yes, hot people are great. Rich people are great, sure. But whatever you have, you adapt to it over time. And so the feeling of being wealthy is something that you get used to, and it doesn't impact your life as much as you'd think. People also overestimate having the same personality or having the same interests. Those matter, but they're not actually huge factors. The things that do matter are things like loyalty, kindness, someone who's emotionally stable, a person who you can fight well with. Yes, fight well, because fighting is inevitable. Somebody who you can make hard. decisions with. And then what's really become the most important one to me, which is what side of you that person brings out. Because I don't care about their resume. I don't care about what's on paper. Who are you when you are with them? Because that's who you'll be for a lot of your life. One of the conversations we've had a lot on the show recently has been to do with the asymmetries in the dating market. That increasingly women are out earning men, they're out educating men, and you have an ever-increasing group of high-performing women competing for an ever-decreasing group of ultra-high-performing turbo chads at the top. Given the fact that you've identified there that looks, money, a lot of the status markers that typically are either utilized, commercialized, weaponized by dating apps and online dating aren't necessarily the things that predict long-term relationship success, how would you advise girls to try and overcome their innate hypergamy, their desire to date up and across to find the dude with the six-figure income that's six foot tall with... a six inch whatever. Yeah, I mean, there are so many interesting historical things here that I can pull from, including just one example. I remember I went to a talk a few years ago where the guy was talking about how like, historically most doctors have been men and men would marry their nurses. And now actually a lot of male doctors marry female doctors. And so what does that even mean in terms of like intermingling of classes and things like that? But yes, the number one piece of advice that I would give women is forget about height. I think that setting height filters just really blocks many people from seeing amazing people. And so yes, when there's a height filter, you might feel tempted to say, okay, I'd like to date a guy who's at least six feet tall and then you make your height minimum six feet tall. And what you may not realize is that only 14% of the American male population is six feet or taller and only 3.9% of the American male population. is 6'3 or taller. And so they're just thinking like, yes, that would be nice, but they don't realize these filters are acting as bouncers where people under that height are not even making it into your club or the people that you can meet. And so there is really no evidence that height impacts long-term relationship success. And in fact, I think that maybe my hottest take here would be date the least attractive person who you're attracted to because you're still attracted to that person. You're caring less about what other people think and you are really maybe finding that hidden gem. And that's a lot of the work that I do with people. It's not settling. Settling is this curse word, the S word that people are so afraid of. I'm not about settling. I'm about saying, what are the things that matter and really go after those? And what are the things that don't and don't be distracted by them? Can you explain the difference between maximizing and satisficing when it comes to decision-making? Yeah, so there's been amazing research done by Barry Schwartz and he has a great. book called the paradox of choice where he talks about these two different ways of making decisions. So maximizing is that you believe that you want to turn over every stone. You want to really do all the research and you want to keep looking and looking and looking until you find the perfect solution. Satisfying is saying I'm going to set a bar and maybe that bar is really high. But once I achieve what I was looking for with that bar, I'm going to be excited about it and stop looking. And so, for example, if you are looking for an espresso machine at home, the maximizer might read the wire cutter reviews, they might read consumer reports, they might go to 10 different shops, and then they finally decide on getting the Breville at home espresso machine. But even when they are drinking it, they might think to themselves, it is a little bitter. I should have gotten this other one. I made a mistake. And there's this sense of you're never done. There could always be something better out there. Whereas the satisficer might say, okay, Nespresso is a good brand. I will go to the downtown. Nespresso store, I will buy the one that is in my price range and that the sales person recommends, and then I will go home and feel good about it. And so the maximizers believe that they are getting the objective best result because of their research, whereas the satisficer is the one who's actually happy. Because in the end, it's not about making the right decision, it's about how you feel about your decision. And the maximizers are never satisfied. And the satisficer is able to say, I got what I wanted, and I feel good about it. How does this manifest in dating? This is a huge problem in modern dating where our culture generally is very focused on maximizers. And so people don't want to choose a restaurant, choose a hotel, choose a purchase without doing tons of research, right? We are the Google Yelp TripAdvisor generation, which is fine if you're going to Tulum and choosing among 16 Airbnbs, but it's not fine when you are choosing among thousands of potential partners and so what is this era of maximizers do they always keep swiping thinking their perfect person is one swipe away and what a satisficer does is they say i want someone who i'm attracted to who would fit in well with my family who's kind and loyal and who i enjoy talking to and when they find that person whatever their requirements are they say i found this person they're great i'm going to invest in the relationship and they don't sit there saying who else is out there and my proverbial coaching couch is full of people who are maximizers saying my girlfriend wants me to propose i really like her but she's just not interested in abstract ideas and couldn't i just be with someone who likes trail running a little bit more and they are imagining that they could come up with this frankenstein person and then that's their perfect partner instead of saying something like i'm really excited about the person that i found and i am going to build  Relationship of my dreams as opposed to finding the perfect partner You have three dating tendencies one of which is the maximizer. Can you lay out the rest of that framework for everyone? Yeah, absolutely. So as I was writing my book, I really like frameworks. I really like recognizing trends and patterns I feel like that's sort of what my brain does. Well, and I was like, alright, I've talked to all these people I You know, some of them are older. Some of them are younger different countries. What do they have in common? It felt like this theme was unrealistic expectations And so the framework is one the romanticizer the person who has unrealistic expectations of relationships Who expects that it's going to be butterflies. There's a soulmate for them. It'll always be easy that they'll know it when they see it and Really? It's this concept of once the relationship starts to feel hard They think oh this can't be my soulmate because it would be effortless with them The second one is the maximizer which we've just talked about unrealistic expectations of their partner. They expect that they're going to find this perfect partner and then everything will work out as opposed to investing in the relationship. And then the third one, which has become a much larger group during the pandemic is the hesitator. They have unrealistic expectations of themselves and they think I'm just not lovable yet. I'm just not ready. I need to be, I need to lose weight. I need a more impressive job title. I need to clean my apartment. Then I'll be ready. And so they have this imaginary date in their mind or moment in their mind. Well, they'll be ready to date when the truth is no one's ever a hundred percent ready for anything. And in fact, the only way to get better at
--------------------------------------------------Summarized Chunk 4:
The text discusses various approaches and considerations for successful dating. The speaker underlines the importance of recognizing patterns from past behavior to make better future decisions. This could include understanding what factors matter in a long-term relationship. The factors such as loyalty, kindness, emotional stability, and the ability to manage conflict are considered more important than looks or money. 

The speaker also talks about maximizing and satisficing during decision-making. Maximizing refers to exhaustive research to make perfect decisions, while satisficing involves setting a high but attainable standard. The satisficer tends to be happier with their decisions than the maximizer, who never feels content. 

This concept of maximizing and satisficing is also applicable to dating; maximizers keep searching for the perfect partner, while satisficers are good to invest in a relationship that matches their key requirements. 

The speaker identifies three dating tendencies: romanticizers who expect an effortless relationship; maximizers who seek the perfect partner; and hesitators who postpone dating due to unrealistic self-expectations. The speaker asserts settling for less attractive but still appealing partners might find a hidden gem, and focuses on inner qualities over superficial traits. 

There was also a mention of asymmetry in the dating market, with high-achieving women competing for a smaller pool of attractive men. The speaker suggests women should ignore height filters as they can exclude potential matches and indicates that height does not impact long-term relationship success.

 dating is by dating. The only way to figure out who you want to be with is by trying on different people in relationships and seeing what works and sitting at home, reading a dating book or thinking about how you might eventually start working out doesn't get you any closer to finding your person. Let's say that someone has identified themselves as one of those three, what's your advice for overcoming that tendency for each of those categories? Yeah. So for the romanticizer, these are often the people who cry when I talk to them because they're like, you want me to give up my love story. You're telling me I have to settle. And I'm like, no, I'm trying to reconfigure in your mind what matters and what doesn't. So the work I do with those people is around giving up on the soulmate. There's so many people out there who could work for you. You can write a life story or a love story with many people. Also understanding that who cares about the we met. People are so focused on this idea of the meet cute, right? Like we met at the farmer's market or he switched his seat on the plane and we sat next to each other and talked for six hours. It's like, who cares? If you're going to be married for 50 years, then the day you met is 0.0055% of your total relationship. So really taking away the Disney, rom-com, Hugo. moments and saying like what's romantic is this these are the things that matter let's get you into a relationship and help you really focus on the things that matter and the things that don't for the maximizer some of it is just understanding what satisficing might look like and so you made kind of a cheeky reference to this before but yes there is this idea of the secretary problem which is this idea that the mathematically correct answer to hiring a secretary is that you go through a third of the possible candidates you say who was the best person from that group that's your benchmark person and the next time that you find someone who you like as much or more than them you hire them so you basically say who's out there I've identified the best of that and then you identify then you go after the next person who matches your benchmark so that you don't waste too much time looking but you don't stop too early and so for the maximizer it's about understanding yeah of course you want to find Great, but it's also what you bring to the relationship how you build it together So stop spending so much time researching and find someone great and build with them and then for the hesitator And I think this is a group that I have had a lot of success with during the pandemic. It's saying to them Stop hesitating and start dating and let's make a deadline for you. Let's choose a few outfits for your dates Let's help you get more comfortable. Maybe you've gained some weight during the pandemic. Maybe it's been a while That's fine Let's actually help you just get out there and get your sea legs back because sitting at home thinking about how you should date Just feels frustrating and so for the hesitator It's really about how can we create action so that you move towards having the identity of being a dater? Are any of your? tendencies related to attachment styles Yeah, I've definitely found that there's some overlap. I've also found that maximizers can be avoid Attached so one of the common things with people who have an avoidant attachment style is that they are looking for excuses to push people away I Talk about in my book a woman whose boyfriend wanted to break up with her because she pronounced the word picture like a picture on the wall as pitcher like a pitcher of water and So it's like really that's what you're gonna break up with someone for and in his mind He turned it into this big thing about Education and class and how articulate she was and how could the mother of my children pronounce it pitcher and it's like dude there's something else going on that is not about the word picture, but you are so focusing on this and Maximizing about it as an avoidant strategy. And so I've definitely seen that I think that many people who have the romanticizer tendencies can be anxiously attached because their vision of love might be that kind of the rom-com 500 days of summer thing where it's loving Love is the chase. Love is convincing somebody to be with you as opposed to love is two people choosing each other. And so I'd say I haven't done a one-to-one analysis and in fact in my class the first session is what's your dating tendency and what's your attachment style? And I do have a lot of anxiously attached maximizers who take my class but in general I think that people come with a whole load of nuanced family background, genetics, histories, and that they can be kind of more complicated than just one of these types. I feel like I would be doing a disservice to everybody to not ask someone that works behind the wall at Hinge about how to design an online dating profile. What's the biggest do's and don'ts and wins and losses? Sure yeah I love this topic I'm super comfortable speaking to it. So yeah so my perspective on a profile is that it's really storytelling and what is the story that you are trying to communicate? And so when I work with clients I start by saying to them, what are the top three things that you want to communicate with your profile? So for someone it might be, I'm from Boston, I love cooking and family is really important to me. And I'm saying, great. Okay, let's make sure we get those points across. Then make sure that you're choosing photos and prompt responses that really support that. And so you don't want to repeat, you know, I love the Red Sox over and over again, but I want to, I want to at least see that represented in one. Another important thing that we found through hinge research is the importance of variety. So sometimes I'll see a profile and it's a guy wearing a pair of sunglasses, taking selfies in front of different monuments around the world. I'm like, dude, we get it. You travel, but I don't see more of you. And so I want a first photo that's kind of like a headshot where I see your face clearly, no filters, no sunglasses. I want at least one photo that's a full body. People have that question. So you might as well show it. Some activity photos, seeing you do some. something that you love. Candids work really well. And then also at least one photo with family and friends show us that you have a social life, but not one where you and your 10 mates are playing rugby and I don't know which one of you are and I have to play. Where's Wally with you? And so really that should be clear. And then for the prompt responses, sometimes people try to be clever and say, you know, um, certain things like I'm, you know, what I'm competitive about. And then they write everything. And it's like, no, we want to see more information about you. That's actually a cliche. So you want to ignore it. And so really using your prompt responses as a way to communicate, who are you? What are you looking for? What makes you different? And remember that your profile is like a t-shirt that you wear into a bar, whatever you wear, people will respond to. And so if you wear a shirt with Madonna on it, you're going to have a different conversation than if you wear a shirt with a game of Thrones character and they're going to lead to different conversations, different types of people. And so most people would benefit from being more intentional about their profile. And even if their profile is great, if you're bored of online dating, switch it up because it will lead to new conversations. Did I hear you say that mirror selfies, gym selfies, and smoking are three big no-nos as well? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, definitely no smoking, nothing too controversial that'll turn people off. The gym selfie, it just does not perform well. Selfies, there are some exceptions to that, especially I feel like some women know how to take really good selfies and they know their angles. But in general, those are not the high performers. You want to go for high quality photos where it's clear what you look like. If you have a friend with a good camera or portrait mode, go to the beach at golden hour and have your friend make you laugh and take a picture of you laughing. Show me what it looks like to be with you and date. you. That is so much better than some poorly lit gym selfie where I'm just like, oh, another, another one of those. What about good and bad practices for online dating beyond the first front window? Yeah, you know, it depends on what the person's needs are. So I work with some people who are way too picky. And our work together is helping them be less picky or less picky about the things that don't matter. Sometimes I work with people who need to be more picky. They go on way too many dates with people who are not interesting or are not interested in them. And so there's an element of kind of which category do you tend to fall into. But let's just say that people are being too picky. I would say, open up your filters, be willing to date someone who's farther away, be open to dating someone who's a little older, a little younger than you might have, and expand your height filters. I would also say that when you are using the app, sometimes people swipe as if, would I marry this person or not? And it should be something like, would I be willing to have a conversation with this person or not? And so for those who are too picky, it's just being more flexible in the early stages because you don't know who's even going to convert into a match. For people who are not picky enough, I would say, how can you have higher standards around who you go on a date with? And so some people I call ZQ, zero questions. This is often men who just ask no questions. So it's like, they're willing to be kind of interviewed, but they don't say, and what about you? And what about you? And so I have women who say to me, after the date, I could have written his
--------------------------------------------------Summarized Chunk 5:
The text provides dating advice primarily for three types of people identified as: the romanticizer, the maximizer, and the hesitator. 

For the romanticizer, the advice given focuses on recalibrating their idea of love, dismissing notions of a specific soulmate or the 'perfect meet-cute.' Instead, they should appreciate that many people could fit their love story and focus on what really matters in a relationship over time, not just on how they met. 

Maximizers are advised to adopt a technique similar to the 'secretary problem' - they should understand what satisfactory looks like, identify their benchmark in potential partners after reviewing about a third, and then settle for the next person who matches or exceeds that. They're encouraged to focus on building the relationship and what they could contribute to it.

The hesitator's advice is essentially to stop hesitating and start dating. They're encouraged to set a deadline, prepare themselves with appropriate outfits, and start dating, thereby moving towards having the identity of being a dater.

The text also comments that dating tendencies can relate to attachment styles, with maximizers can often be avoidantly attached and romanticizers possibly having anxious attachment. 

Additionally, some advice on constructing an online dating profile is given. This involves storytelling - conveying the top three things about oneself, using photographs that provide variety and a full representation (including clear headshot, full body, activity, candid, and social situation photos), answering prompts accurately to provide more details, and being intentional about the profile. It is recommended that individuals avoid controversial issues, gym selfies, and poor quality photos. Different profiles can lead to different conversations and interactions.

Good and bad practices for online dating are also discussed. Too-picky daters should be more open to potential partners, while those who aren't picky enough should have higher standards about who they go on a date with.

 biography, but he didn't ask me a single question about myself. And when I ask these ZQ men what they're doing, they're like, well, she has something to say. She could have spoken up or I just thought she thought I was so interesting. It's like, no dude, good conversation is we are taking turns talking and you show interest in me and you ask follow-up questions. And so that's just kind of a general point that people should certainly be making statements, sharing about themselves, and then asking questions so that it feels like a conversation, not an interview. Is it true that on average, if you have a conversation where somebody asks more questions, they tend to come across more likable than somebody that makes the same number of statements? Yeah, there's really great research on this. It basically shows that the more questions you ask and the less time you spend talking, the more that person thinks you're a great conversationalist, because essentially what you're tapping into is people like talking about themselves. People like to be made to feel as if they are fascinating. And so like right now, you've been asking me questions for an hour. I feel great. I'm like, wow, you know, Chris is so curious about me and I must be so interesting, even though like, of course, we're in a dynamic where this is the setup, you're asking me questions, but it feels really good. And so think about that and apply it to dating. It's much more important to be interested, showing interest in the. person than to be interesting. And so when I have people who say to me, I haven't been on a trip in two years and nothing's going on in my life, I'm not interesting. How could I date? I'm like, you are at an advantage. It doesn't matter. Just go out there and ask deep questions, flirt with people, be vulnerable, be curious, use a support response where you ask deeper questions about what's going on for them, as opposed to a shift response where you bring the conversation back to you. And this person will think that you are endlessly fascinating. I suppose it's difficult if you and somebody else who's also taken the same red pill about how to have conversations in dates, that's just going to end up with you going like, what about you? No, no, no, no, no. What about you? Uh, so yeah, that could, I could imagine that coming to a stalemate. Yeah. Yeah. In my dating class, we do a lot of live demos and I actually did one last week where I made this mistake where I was trying to show how to ask good questions, but I wasn't letting the person ask me questions back. So it really just felt like I was interrogating them and then two students did it and I was like, thank goodness you went because they actually took turns asking, responding, going deeper. And so it should not have a feeling of like one person is the podcast interviewer and the other one is the guest. You also have to share. You talk about the spark and you've got a problem with the spark. What's up with that? Yeah, the spark is that moment where you feel instant chemistry, you feel fireworks, you feel like the whole world has stopped except for you and this person. And the spark is definitely real. I have certainly felt the spark with people throughout my life. The issue with it and why I think it's a really big problem in modern dating is that people are overly optimizing for it. And so my clients would say things to me like this one guy, Jonathan would say, I met this guy. He was great. We had a good conversation. He planned a fun date. I'm not going to see him again. And when I'd say why he'd say, I just didn't feel Spark and so he was going on dates expecting to have this magical moment. And so yes, the spark is real, but we also Expect to have it too often. And so there's research that only 11% of people experience love at first sight I would also say that because of the mere exposure effect We often like things more over time as we're more exposed to them so it's why we might like a Person who lives in our apartment building who we see every day or you might even like a song the more that you hear it And so the spark can grow over time People are sometimes just very sparky. Some people are really good-looking They're really charismatic that can also be tied to narcissism and so certain people give everyone the spark, but you think it's something special with you and finally, the third issue is that the spark doesn't mean that you have a long-term lasting connection and Many divorced couples or unhappily married couples started with the spark and so it's enough to kind of get you off the ground But not to keep going and so my entire advice my antidote to this is to go after the slow burn Which is the person who might not spark with you on the first date? But the more you go out with them the more you like them over time the more you peel back the layers and you realize how funny or curious or Brilliant they are and a lot of people have passed them by because they're not sparky But you could wind up with this amazing engaging partner because you are willing to give them that second look I think that's one of the most interesting insights that I've taken from the stuff that you've done, which is that The spark can be something systemic about a person and not unique to your interaction with them and this makes sense, right? I've had tons of conversations about narcissism and dark triad traits and stuff like that and those individuals They are sparking the guy at the grocery store They are sparking the bus driver that you know, that's just part of their existence And using that as a proxy for, there is something exciting about this, meaning there is something that has long-term longevity. It's just a leap that's being made way too much. And I think again, as well, you're seeing one of the problems of culture taking a hold of one very particular element and then just myopically focusing on it and saying, well, this is something that's really, really important. And you look at every rom-com movie throughout time. Actually, no, that's a lie that I'm, I'm, I'm incorrect. There, there are rom-com movies where the good guy that's kind of the hapless romantic that's chasing the girl. She does sometimes end up with with him, but there is also a lot of push toward the spark given that it happens, whatever 11% of the time. It's definitely not only in 11% of rom-com movies. Totally. Yeah, absolutely. And so this kind of goes back to the point you made earlier Chris, which is like what is making it into the movies and it's like most movies and there are a few exceptions like the before trilogy. Most movies are. very focused on the meet cute, okay, she's so clumsy, he's too focused on work. And then they go through trials and tribulations and then they end up together. But where the movie ends is them coming together as a couple and then it's the famous three words, right? They lived happily ever after. But the movie ends that they're coming together. It doesn't tell you what's going on. You're 12 into the marriage, when their kid is having trouble at school and they haven't had sex in a year and all of this stuff. And so our movies are selling us on the happily ever after early stage, not the long-term relationship success. And this idea of the spark, after having written my book and talking to a lot of people about it, like I totally notice it out and about. Like if I go to a party or a conference, everyone will kind of be talking about the same person. Oh, did you meet so-and-so? Oh, so-and-so's presentation was so great. It's like, yeah, that person's really sparky and everyone here is drawn to them. Often they're very conventionally attractive. or they make great eye contact with you, or they do that thing where they make you feel interesting. But it's like- That Bill Clinton style. Yeah, the Bill Clinton style thing, exactly, right? You feel like you're the only person in the room and it's like, yes, that person is very sparky. We are all feeling a spark with that person. That doesn't mean anything for like who we should all be with. And so just knowing that that spark sensation is real, but understanding that it's more representative of that person than your dynamic, I think does really help you move past it. That's a huge red pill. That's really, really interesting. I think as well, one of the things that I find so attractive in a relationship is when I admire my partner. Like if I admire the girl that I'm with, then it's such a compelling pull of attraction toward them. However, anybody that has a spark is admirable because you look at them and you think, oh God, you know, everybody else wants them. You've got this sort of crowdsourced sense of the toys in the playground type thing. Charisma generally, extraversion generally, you know, likability, humor, all that stuff that we've talked about. So yeah, decoupling those is really interesting. And I think asking yourself the question of seriously, is this person just like this with everybody or is this person specifically like this because of me is probably a good one to ask. I think since this is personally you, we could like even zoom in on it a little bit more, which is, do you know this concept of the halo effect? Yes, which is people that are good looking tend on average to be treated better by everyone in society. Right, and like, I know that I do this all the time. I mean, people even do this with good looking babies. Our whole lives, if you are good looking, people ascribe positive traits to you. Oh, she's good looking, she must be generous, she must be kind, she must be smart and compassionate. So part of what you're describing is the halo effect of when somebody is good looking, we ascribe all these other traits to them. The other thing that you're talking about, the admiring your partner, yes, that is huge. And I think people should be thinking about that more. Maybe for you or for anyone else who's experiencing this, it's
--------------------------------------------------Summarized Chunk 6:
The text covers several aspects of communication and dating. The speaker advises taking turns in conversations, stating that research shows that individuals who ask more questions are perceived as better conversationalists, because people enjoy the opportunity to talk about themselves. It appeals to the human desire to feel interesting and appreciated. The speaker suggests that showing genuine interest in a person is more important than striving to be viewed as interesting yourself. 

Addressing the concept of "the spark", the speaker argues that while that initial surge of chemistry can certainly occur, it's an overemphasized aspect of modern dating. Though some individuals might generate a "spark" in others through charisma or physical attractiveness, this doesn't necessarily indicate long-term compatibility. The speaker promotes the alternative idea of a "slow burn," where attraction and connection grow over time.

The speaker also discusses the problem of using "the spark" as a measurement of long-term success in relationships, highlighting how movies and culture often focus on an instantaneous attraction. They reference the "halo effect" where attractive people are often attributed with other positive qualities regardless of whether they possess them. The text ends with the speaker affirming the importance of admiring your partner in a relationship.
--------------------------------------------------Original Chunk 7:
 saying, when I think about admiring someone, I want to admire them because I can learn from them, because they have a passion, because they have pursued their dreams and really being concrete around what this admiration is versus this more nebulous halo effect admiration, which is everyone else seems to want them, so I should want them too. It's almost more of the market dynamics or evolutionary biology piece. It's not actually about admiration. It's saying, well, if everyone else values them, clearly they are of value. What's the difference between sliding and deciding through a relationship? Yeah, so there's great research on how people make decisions in relationships, and a lot of couples slide, which is they just slip from one relationship moment to the next. So for example, you know, you and I have been dating for six months, my lease is up, and I say, hey, Chris, should I renew my lease or not, and you're like, hmm, that'd be good  at rent, why don't you move in? We didn't talk about what does moving in mean to me? Does it mean we're on our way to get engaged? Does it mean we're gonna figure out if we're good partners? Maybe it means nothing, but what other couples do is they decide. They sit down and they actually have a conversation explicitly about what this milestone means. And so they might say, moving into me means we are engaged to be engaged. And the other person might say, moving into me just means we're gonna spend more time together. And then they might say, okay, we're not on the same page. Let's actually wait until we are. And the research shows that couples who decide have healthier relationships, they have more passion, they have better sex, they're more likely to survive through the long haul. And so in this theme of intentional dating or intentional love, deciding is the intentional way to make major relationship milestone decisions. That was the sense that I had in my mind, this tension between it being natural and spontaneous and emergent. and it being, I don't know, I don't know what people, there is almost everybody that's listening to this will be intentional with everything that they do, right? They'll eat intentionally, they'll sleep intentionally, they'll know the temperature of the air conditioning that they go to sleep in if they're in a warm country or whatever, so it's probably not. But that more autistic view of things that does take things and then separate it out step by step, you think, well, I don't know. That to me seems like the smart thing to do. Is there any tension between that and sort of romance and spontaneity? Can you see a world in which someone sort of overshoots with regards to their intentionality? I can definitely see that. And we talked a little bit about the secretary problem and the 37%, and I really see clients and I see emails that say, okay, Logan, so I'm this old and I've dated this many people and this is my benchmark person, but they rejected me. Does that make them my benchmark person? There can definitely be a feeling of, I want to have ultimate control over this. And if I have enough. Spreadsheets and enough format conditioning then everything will work out. And so I do think that there's pushing this too far So instead, how can you think about this as a layer upon which you view the world? Versus a decision like every single decision that you make and so what this might look like is someone's gonna say Being intentional about love to me is going to therapy to own my past trauma and drama Having a rough sense of what I'm looking for Going on dates where I'm open-minded and I understand. Oh, I don't actually like this person I'm just excited because they don't like me and I want to have the chase having open conversations from the beginning about who I am what I'm looking for and then as you go through the different phases saying What does defining the relationship mean to you? Should we move in together? Should we get engaged? So it's some key moments But other than that adding as much spontaneity as you want surprise that person take them on a getaway Like there's love lots of ways to be romantic in the day-to-day. I just don't want you to miss these big moments because that's when people make the big mistakes. Talking about on the other side of relationships, how should people know whether or not they can or should break up with their partner? Yeah, you know, when I set out to do this work, I certainly never thought that I would be talking to people about breakups, but it's become a passion of mine in terms of the unique research that I've done, and I do have a lot of conversations with people where they say, should I stay or should I go? And so I have a few practices that I walk them through. So one is kind of going off the same theme, saying what's your historical tendency? Do you tend to be a hitcher, someone who stays in relationships way too long, past the expiration date? Do you tend to be a ditcher, a person who stays in relationships way too short, always hopping from new relationship energy to the next honeymoon phase, things like that. So we talk about that. We talk about, what are you bringing to the relationship? Are you bringing your best self? Have you told the other person how you feel or do you just expect them to magically know what you want? And then are there external factors? Did one of you lose a job lose a parent as somebody going through mental health stuff? Like is this a temporary moment in time where things could get better? And then I asked them this final question, which is kind of silly but in this fun abstract way where I say It's called the wardrobe test and I say if your partner were a piece of clothing in your closet something that you own what would they be and Sometimes people say my boyfriend is a wool sweater. He keeps me warm, but it's itchy. So I have to take it off or my boyfriend is an Ratty t-shirt that I would wear to the gym But I wouldn't want anyone to see me in and these are real answers that people have given me. I'm like, okay, listen to yourself That's how you actually feel taking yourself out of your super rational brain into your emotions How you feel is that you've outgrown this relationship or that something feels off and then we work on helping them make a plan to leave. Some people say lovely things like my girlfriend is my favorite pair of pants that I would never have bought for myself but make me feel attractive and fun. And so I like the wardrobe test question because you can make a million pro con list but sometimes you just have to get in touch with how you're actually feeling. What's the hitcher and ditcher is such a good way to kind of split groups up I think pretty much everybody that I know falls into one of those two categories. What is the typical piece of advice or the first few pieces of advice that you give to each person from that group to overcome it? Yeah and I would say you know I do have a lot of frameworks and terms that some will resonate with some people some won't. I think there are people that are not hitchers or ditchers they leave the relationship at the appropriate time but let's say most people are for the hitchers a lot of them is understanding this concept of sunk cost fallacy. So I'm sure you know this from economics but if you spent $20 on a concert ticket and then you're deciding. deciding if you should go or not, you might say, Oh, I should go because I spent the $20. It's like you spent the $20 regardless. It doesn't impact the money if you go. And so this idea of when you made a decision, um, you throw good money after bad and you keep feeling like you have to double down on it. When maybe you can just say, I'm going to cut my losses $20, I'm not going to go to the concert. And so they feel like I've been dating this person for so long, I have to keep going. That's not necessarily true. Maybe you should have left the relationship years ago and maybe this is a great quality. You're very loyal. You believe that people can change, but you might need a readjustment for ditchers. And I do think this is highly tied to the avoidant attachment style. There's a feeling of weight. It doesn't feel like it did at the beginning. In the beginning I was thinking about that person all the time and it was so exciting and this and that. And then they just feel like they want to move on to the next thing. And so this is a lot of work where I do it with people, where I. help them understand, love is a drug. When you do brain scans of people who are falling in love, it literally lights up part of their brains that are lit up when they do drugs like cocaine. And so understanding- So you're saying quit the relationship and start a cocaine habit. I'm saying you already have a cocaine habit and the cocaine is the love. And so understand that, yeah, you are in this different place and your brain is being stimulated, but that doesn't last forever and it's probably a good thing. And so there is gonna be this transition from falling in love to being in love. And if you just wanna spend your whole life falling in love, and there are people like that, you can do it. But if you want to be in a long-term relationship, get married, be a dad, whatever it is, you're gonna have to accept that the falling will feel different from the being and how can we make you excited about the being? And I've spoken to a lot of men who are really successful, I really respect, and they talk about how much they love being married. And they're like, partner is this closet where you're hanging these different stories and parts of yourself and memories and this person has been with you through all of life and you get to have that partner and that that is really beautiful. And sure, like seducing someone or those honeymoon period feelings are really good. But if you want to move from the honeymoon stage to the being in love stage, you do have to have different expectations for what that feels like. I read

Admiration in a relationship should be based on the real qualities of the person, such as their passion, their drive to pursue dreams, rather than a perception based on market dynamics or the opinions of others. In relationships, there is a difference between 'sliding' or moving from one relationship moment to the next without explicit understanding of what it means, and 'deciding', where couples have explicit conversations about what relationship milestones mean. Research shows that couples who 'decide' or talk about these milestones have healthier, more passionate relationships and are more likely to stay together.

The process of intentional dating revolves around major relationship milestone decisions. However, being overly intentional can risk losing romance and spontaneity, thus, it is suggested to be intentional only at key moments. It includes going to therapy to deal with past trauma, having a sense of what one is looking for, going on dates with an open mind, and having open conversations about wants and needs. 

When deciding to break up, one has to consider their historical tendencies, their ability to bring their best self to the relationship, external factors that could be impacting the relationship, and their genuine feelings about their partner. It's important to know when to 'cut your losses' in a relationship, particularly in cases of a sunk cost fallacy where the relationship should have ended long ago but goes on because of a feeling of already having invested in the relationship. Understanding the transition from falling in love to being in love can help individuals who tend to jump from relationship to relationship due to the exciting new love feeling.
--------------------------------------------------Original Chunk 8:
 a while ago that there's two attraction systems. Is it the passionate and the companionate system? Have you heard these before? Vaguely, but I'm not super knowledgeable about them. There's a lot of frameworks that are like three different types of love and stuff like that, but not, I don't have expertise in it. It just matches onto what you're saying here that you kind of have the, I don't know, that first period that pretty much everybody is, is familiar with. And then when that begins to wane a little bit and it becomes much more of a friendship, a deep friendship with benefits and love. of as opposed to this sort of head over heels obsession that occurs in the first instance, that kind of ties into the spark thing as well, right? That that's how it should feel all the time. And I think, yeah, that's probably pretty erroneous. So let's say that someone's got themselves to the stage where they know that the relationship isn't for them. What do you advise people to do if they need to actually pull the pin and get themselves out of a relationship? You know, it's so interesting. Someone might ask me like, what are some of the most meaningful moments in your work? And you might think I would say like, oh, when I introduced this couple or helped this person notice red flags, but the things that really stick out to me are helping people get out of relationships that are no longer serving them because sometimes you really need a push or a partner or a plan. And so I approach breakups like the way that I would approach goal setting and I use goal setting research. And so when I help people plan their breakup, we talk about things like, okay, when are you gonna do this? Let's create a deadline. Let's talk about what you're gonna say, what you're making. Messages are let's talk about how you should not have sex afterwards because that will just be confusing for both of you There's Even conversations around things like when are you going to be in touch with them? How long should the conversation be? What are you gonna do to make yourself feel better afterwards? How can you avoid being the nice breakup person who thinks it's nice to check in with them all the time But actually you're confusing them. And so we really just take the very messy heart-breaking effort of decoupling and we turn it into a plan that is Compassionate to them and compassion to the other person and then I help them execute it and stick to their goal of being broken up What about overcoming heartbreak? Yeah, you know breakups We just talked about this But if love is a drug then breaking up with someone often feels like withdrawal and there's lots of evidence that it's physically painful that you are you perform worse on Cognitive tests people are actually more likely to commit crimes. There's some really interesting research on how Challenging it is to actually navigate a breakup. And so for anyone listening, I would just say give yourself a beat This is hard. There are activities that you can do. So there's great research from Gary Lewandowski who talks about rediscover yourself activities So what are the things in your relationship that you didn't really pursue because your partner didn't like them. So if you Love going to the beach, but your partner was pale-skinned Maybe you haven't been if you love jazz and your partner hated it You weren't going to jazz shows go do more of those rediscover yourself activities And those people seem to move on from breakups and feel happier Than people who just go out there and do kind of like generic activities like going for a walk or spending time with friends You can also do a lot of journaling to sort of help your brain get through the breakup faster so you can make lists of all the bad qualities about the person, you can make a list of all the parts of the relationship that were bad, and you're basically thinking about your brain as this rationalization monster and how do you feed the monster by saying, oh, yeah, he was rude to my sister. Oh, yeah, she never did pick me up from the airport that time. And so you're actually helping yourself remember why it wasn't as great as you might be thinking. And then there's also this expression, time heals all wounds. Well, I think the updated version is that meaning heals all wounds, and you can really apply meaning to it by saying, what did I learn? How will I be different next time? Who should I go for in the future? And so really not just assuming that time will make things better, but by really creating a story of this was an experience, I am better for it, I am more informed in the future, and I will move on.

Two types of attraction systems have been identified - the passionate system and the companionate system. Passionate love usually occurs early in relationships when individuals are consumed with their partner, but often wanes and transitions into companionate love which is more akin to deep friendship with romantic benefits. Breakups can be a significant part of a relationship when it no longer serves individuals well. Breakups should be approached with thoughtful planning and goal setting. Creating a breakup plan can help reduce confusion and encourage a compassionate split. 

Overcoming heartbreak, frequently compared to drug withdrawal, is a difficult process involving physical pain and cognitive impact. The relationship expert, Logan Ury, advises individuals to engage in "rediscover yourself activities" in order to cope with breakups. This involves pursuing things that were not possible while with the partner. Journaling helps process emotions faster by making lists of negative aspects about the relationship or the ex-partner. Creating a story of self-growth and learning from the relationship helps with healing rather than relying on time alone. Logan Ury is accessible through Instagram, Twitter and her class, Date Smarter, for more relationship advice and guidance.
--------------------------------------------------Original Chunk 1:
The text discusses the role of Logan Ury, the Director of Relationship Science at Hinge. In Ury's role, she works with a team of researchers to explore different aspects of dating habits and how they impact relationships. They have performed studies around topics such as mental health in dating, revealing that 86% of people prioritize mental health in relationships and even prefer dating people who go to therapy. She and her team also investigated the trend of Gen Z constantly seeking advice from their friends about dating, encouraging this generation to rely on their own feelings instead. Ury highlighted the effect of ever-present digital surveillance on dating behavior, creating a sense of paranoia that inhibits people's natural behaviors. The text discusses how the perspective on love, dating, and romance has changed in the year 2022, specifically in regards to a younger, Gen Z audience. The speaker identifies themselves as a millennial dating expert and has worked with many millennial clients, particularly users of the dating app 'Hinge'. However, they feel a growing need to understand the Gen Z perspective as they age into the dating market.

One observation is that society is moving towards more fluid concepts of gender identity, sexual orientation, and relationship structure. Not all individuals are seeking "the one" or focused on marriage, and non-monogamous relationships or not having children due to concerns such as climate change are more common. The speaker stresses that despite societal shifts, the desire to love and be loved remains a constant, regardless of generation.

The speaker also mentions feeling out-of-touch due to rapid generational changes and the rise of Gen Z influence, comparing it to the feeling their parents might have had when they were getting into Facebook, online dating, and other practices. This highlights the cultural gap between different generations.

The speaker also discusses growing older and the changes that come with it. At the age of 34, they note a decrease in physical abilities and recovery. However, they emphasize the importance of wisdom, empathy, grace, and confidence as attributes that can grow with age. They also contemplate the concept of choosing a life partner, considering factors such as the increasing lifespan of humans.

Lastly, the speaker challenges the perceived 'ick' factor of having an intentional approach to designing a lifestyle around dating, which they believe to be their mission and perspective as a dating expert. The text primarily focuses on the modern understanding and approach towards love, dating, and relationships. The writer opines that there is a cultural trend to romanticize love as a concept that cannot be analyzed or understood scientifically. Nonetheless, they argue that love should be looked at from a logical perspective, especially since dating is a relatively modern concept, with the author highlighting changes in gender dynamics and the advent of online dating. The writer advocates for the use of science in understanding love and building successful relationships. 

They emphasize that while love might be natural and organic, dating isn't, and people aren't born with an innate understanding of it. The author references a book called "The Labor of Love" by Maura Weigel, which discusses this evolution. 

They also mention the impact of media on people's perception of love and relationships, often portraying an idealized, naturalistic approach that could be further from the actual reality of making relationships work. The author distinguishes courtship and flirting from the essence of romance, which they believe lies in the deep connection and trust that is maintained over time.

The writer also expresses the notion that people's reluctance to adopt a scientific understanding of love could be due to fear of culpability for their dating failures. However, they observe that individuals already take personal responsibility for their lack of success in love. The writer advocates for people to learn to be content with their decisions related to relationships, highlighting that the focus should be on building long-term, committed relationships rather than on the fleeting feelings often portrayed in media. The text discusses various approaches and considerations for successful dating. The speaker underlines the importance of recognizing patterns from past behavior to make better future decisions. This could include understanding what factors matter in a long-term relationship. The factors such as loyalty, kindness, emotional stability, and the ability to manage conflict are considered more important than looks or money. 

The speaker also talks about maximizing and satisficing during decision-making. Maximizing refers to exhaustive research to make perfect decisions, while satisficing involves setting a high but attainable standard. The satisficer tends to be happier with their decisions than the maximizer, who never feels content. 

This concept of maximizing and satisficing is also applicable to dating; maximizers keep searching for the perfect partner, while satisficers are good to invest in a relationship that matches their key requirements. 

The speaker identifies three dating tendencies: romanticizers who expect an effortless relationship; maximizers who seek the perfect partner; and hesitators who postpone dating due to unrealistic self-expectations. The speaker asserts settling for less attractive but still appealing partners might find a hidden gem, and focuses on inner qualities over superficial traits. 

There was also a mention of asymmetry in the dating market, with high-achieving women competing for a smaller pool of attractive men. The speaker suggests women should ignore height filters as they can exclude potential matches and indicates that height does not impact long-term relationship success. The text provides dating advice primarily for three types of people identified as: the romanticizer, the maximizer, and the hesitator. 

For the romanticizer, the advice given focuses on recalibrating their idea of love, dismissing notions of a specific soulmate or the 'perfect meet-cute.' Instead, they should appreciate that many people could fit their love story and focus on what really matters in a relationship over time, not just on how they met. 

Maximizers are advised to adopt a technique similar to the 'secretary problem' - they should understand what satisfactory looks like, identify their benchmark in potential partners after reviewing about a third, and then settle for the next person who matches or exceeds that. They're encouraged to focus on building the relationship and what they could contribute to it.

The hesitator's advice is essentially to stop hesitating and start dating. They're encouraged to set a deadline, prepare themselves with appropriate outfits, and start dating, thereby moving towards having the identity of being a dater.

The text also comments that dating tendencies can relate to attachment styles, with maximizers can often be avoidantly attached and romanticizers possibly having anxious attachment. 

Additionally, some advice on constructing an online dating profile is given. This involves storytelling - conveying the top three things about oneself, using photographs that provide variety and a full representation (including clear headshot, full body, activity, candid, and social situation photos), answering prompts accurately to provide more details, and being intentional about the profile. It is recommended that individuals avoid controversial issues, gym selfies, and poor quality photos. Different profiles can lead to different conversations and interactions.

Good and bad practices for online dating are also discussed. Too-picky daters should be more open to potential partners, while those who aren't picky enough should have higher standards about who they go on a date with. The text covers several aspects of communication and dating. The speaker advises taking turns in conversations, stating that research shows that individuals who ask more questions are perceived as better conversationalists, because people enjoy the opportunity to talk about themselves. It appeals to the human desire to feel interesting and appreciated. The speaker suggests that showing genuine interest in a person is more important than striving to be viewed as interesting yourself. 

Addressing the concept of "the spark", the speaker argues that while that initial surge of chemistry can certainly occur, it's an overemphasized aspect of modern dating. Though some individuals might generate a "spark" in others through charisma or physical attractiveness, this doesn't necessarily indicate long-term compatibility. The speaker promotes the alternative idea of a "slow burn," where attraction and connection grow over time.

The speaker also discusses the problem of using "the spark" as a measurement of long-term success in relationships, highlighting how movies and culture often focus on an instantaneous attraction. They reference the "halo effect" where attractive people are often attributed with other positive qualities regardless of whether they possess them. The text ends with the speaker affirming the importance of admiring your partner in a relationship. Admiration in a relationship should be based on the real qualities of the person, such as their passion, their drive to pursue dreams, rather than a perception based on market dynamics or the opinions of others. In relationships, there is a difference between 'sliding' or moving from one relationship moment to the next without explicit understanding of what it means, and 'deciding', where couples have explicit conversations about what relationship milestones mean. Research shows that couples who 'decide' or talk about these milestones have healthier, more passionate relationships and are more likely to stay together.

--------------------------------------------------Processed Raw Transcript:
1. Understand That Love is Evolving: Wisdom, empathy, grace, and confidence are essential in selecting a life partner. Cherish and respect the unfolding aspects of romantic love and view them as opportunities for personal and mutual growth.

2. Identify Your Dating Tendencies: Know if you're a romanticizer, maximizer, or hesitator. Romanticizers should focus on the features that matter in a relationship over time, maximizers should apply the 'secretary problem' technique to avoid making snap judgments, and hesitators should start dating instead of postponing it constantly.

3. Create a Compelling Online Dating Profile: Your profile is your chance to tell your story. Avoid controversial topics, poor quality photos, and cliche gym selfies. 

4. Promote Healthy Communication: Communication is key in any relationship. Dismiss the misconception of an immediate 'spark' and favor the 'slow-burn' approach that breeds profound attraction over time.

5. Assess When to End a Relationship: Take into account past patterns, your capacity to invest in the relationship, external pressures and your genuine feelings. Beware of the 'sunk cost fallacy' and avoid maintaining a relationship that is causing harm just because of the time you invested in it. 

6. Strategically Plan Breakups: When necessary, breakups should be conducted with care, planning and clear communication. They should be goal oriented towards achieving a compassionate split.

7. Recover From the Breakup: Breakups can be equated to overcoming heartbreak and indeed may be as hard as drug withdrawal. Discover or rediscover activities you love - these may help distract and provide comfort. Journal your feelings and thoughts as this may give you more insight into your emotions and eventually help you embrace a narrative of growth from the experience.

8. Seek Professional Guidance: Reach out to experts or therapists to help navigate through the aftermath of a divorce or major breakup. Not only can they provide guidance for future relationships, but they can also help deal with past issues and emotions.

You are someone who has spent the last 20 years focusing on training, especially for hypertrophy. You are someone that has won pretty much every single title on the planet. You have 10 exercises that you can do for the rest of your life in order to maintain as good of a physique as you can. What are they and why? 10? That's very specific. 10. I just figured that that would be enough for you to get each different muscle group. Right, okay. So what are the longest levers that you can pull when it comes to maintaining size or increasing size for the muscle group? A lot of obviously compound lifts. So you're looking at your deadlifts, your bench press and your squats. They're always good. Again, these are things that I've had to adapt over the years because of injuries and things, training silly when I was younger. Okay, there's three. There's three there. Hanging leg raise for core. It's one of the hardest midsection. If you do it properly, I think it's one of the hardest midsection exercises, but it's phenomenal for your... transverse abdominis, your upper and lower abdominals, everything, just, it's a great, I feel like that was something that helped me build my midsection. You've got one of the acclaimed best midsections in all of fitness. What are the cues that people get wrong when they're doing hanging leg raises? So the create momentum, the swing, which I think that has a bit to do with CrossFit with this kipping, malarkey and momentum stuff that came into play a fair few years ago. But yeah, I think swinging, I think using the hip flexors instead of the midsection. How do you know if you're doing that? You'll feel it, you'll feel it down your quads. What's the cue? Someone's doing a, someone's listening to this hanging from a bar right now. What is the cue for them to go from, I'm hanging straight to I'm doing a leg raise that makes it work appropriately? So is it tucking the hips in and making sure you're contracting your upper and lower abdominals before anything else? So it's always keeping them fully contracted. Mind to muscle connection is a huge thing. I believe in that so much. Yeah, Mike Thurston does the same. yeah and the thing is the last few years I've done that so much more now as I've got older and more mature I'm not just trying to lift heavy weight and trying to ego lift and since I've done that the muscle maturity and how my body's developed it's just exponential I just wish I'd done it five six years ago so yeah so I think that's very important mind to muscle connection with hanging leg raises you're going to an L you're going up to touch the bar so either so I used to do all the way to the top and but I alternate now so I just do a bit of both I think there's a there's a place for both of them but I think that when you go past a certain point you are recruiting other muscle groups so if you want to just isolate your midsection just go to 90 degrees how do you do progressive overload on that or do you you or you could add weights to you do you I don't personally know because I was obsessed with my midsection growing up as you say Rob Riches was the guy who got me obsessed with it so I wanted to be on the front covers like Rob was I used to see all the magazines and I try to to treat my midsection like any other muscle part. A lot of people think with the midsection, you should train 30 minutes after every session or why? Every other muscle part we train, we train to break the muscle fibers down heavy, a lot of load, we break the muscle fibers and we let them recover two, three, four days before we hit them again. And that's how I looked and viewed my midsection. So I'd give them two full hour sessions with a three to four day rest between and I'd six to eight rep range really heavy. The thing with that, I started to develop really chunky abs, blocky abs, but then it started to look a bit distended because I'd gone too far with it and I was causing so many back problems, had slipped discs from it. And basically it's because I was too front heavy, too front strong. So it took a lot of years to start having to hyperextend. For every crunch I did, they said I had to do two hyperextensions. Wow. So yeah, it was- You needed to compensate for all of that anterior strength that you developed. And so now- don't tend to go too heavy and we do a lot of own body weight stuff. Okay cool, so you've got four, you've got squat, bench, deadlift, hanging leg raises, six more slots to keep your body. So I'd go with some isolation work, so we'll probably go with like an incline dumbbell chest just because you can do a lot of different variations on that but I think it's great for development. Shoulders aren't getting much work at the moment. Alright, shoulder press, we'll go with a dumbbell shoulder press because it's great for isolation, unilateral and that's quite important. Obviously leg work, so we need to do some hamstring work, so we would do, I would say stiff leg deadlift but no, I think if we're gonna try and create some growth I think we're gonna go for like a lying hamstring curl heavy. You prefer a lying to a seated? I do, yes, yeah I do. Well, I don't know if that's down to the fact I just get better contraction off that. I think it's personal preference in my eyes. I've always said that with any type of exercises, if you feel an exercise more than another, stick with it, go with it, do the extra sets and reps on that particular exercise because that's where you're gonna get the most out of it. If you're doing an exercise because someone else has told you to do it and you're not getting that mind tunnel connection or you're not feeling it, there's no point. And that's what I love about bodybuilding as well. Nutrition and training, you adapt it to you. It's an individual sport. You can have people around you supporting you, but your metabolism and the way you train, the way you eat, it all falls on you. So learn the body yourself and adapt as you go. Okay, three left. What have you got? I've lost where we are now. Squat, bench, deadlift, hanging leg raise, incline chest press with dumbbells, shoulder press. Seated calf raise. Seated calf raise. Oh, so you wanna get the soleus moving. Yeah, we'll get them in. Okay. Okay. We'll cover them. And then two left. We need overhead tricep extension rope. Pivoted from the bottom of a pulley? Yeah. Right, okay, yeah. What are the cues that people get wrong there? Because this is something that I absolutely love to do, but where do people go wrong? Mechanically quite a complex movement. Yeah, I think you can go too heavy too soon and start recruiting and start, yeah, pulling. I don't know, with the shoulder, I think it's important to lock your elbows in a fixed position as well as the shoulder, make sure there's no movement there. I like to elongate and stretch it out. Not a lot of people go too far with it, but I like to overextend slightly to get a full stretch and a full contraction at the top. One more. We need biceps, don't we? Then we've got everything then. What's your number one bicep exercise? You know what I'm going to say? I'm going to say it, and this is a bit of an outward one this, because I've done loads of them today, is pull-ups. Close grip pull-ups. I know it's a back workout, but your second... muscle is bicep and the contraction I get off that for my bicep every week I hit them. I always want to bring my back up anyway so it's an excuse to just hit the back as well but I think that's a great overall exercise. Given the fact that you've added deadlifts in, what is it that you're finding as a physique competitor that first off isn't massively judged on your legs and secondly wants a narrow torso? Why would you put deadlifts into that kind of a workout? So I've never believed this. I don't know if scientifically this is right but with deadlifting I've never... I used to deadlift every week. I don't so much now. I do a lot more isolation on hyperextensions again because I get a better contraction. I do hypers. I prefer to deadlift but I do hypers mainly. But with a deadlift obviously it recruits nearly every muscle in the body so it's great for for an overall workout but I've lost my train of thought. Why are you using deadlifts given that you want to have a small waist? Yeah like I say because I train my midsection the way I do, I do a lot of iso-tension in the morning. morning. What's that? So it's basically all about ISO holds. So you breathe in, fully breathe in, exhale every bit of air out of the body and you crunch your abs as hard as you can for three seconds. Standing up? Standing up, yeah. You can do that with any muscle part. So it's the most monotonous thing a bodybuilder can do but it's one of the best things for muscle control, for getting everything tight, for condition. I challenge anybody to do this. So we'll keep it simple. Three from the front, three from the side. So you've got three on the obliques on either side. So you inhale, hands over your head, as you come down you crunch, you exhale every bit of air out, you crunch and hold it for three seconds as hard as you can. It's good to have your top off because you need to seriously tense. Do it again. Crunch. Try and do that ten times and then go to the side and then crunch down, hold and then do that ten times and then do that ten times. Have 30 seconds rest, go again and then go again. I do it five rounds and you're literally dripping wet through and the blood volume you get in your midsection is insane. So you can do that with like with your biceps or between exercises. So if you're doing a yeah, like a bicep curl, you go straight in, you hold your pose, a double bicep and you hold, you squeeze your midsection, you squeeze your biceps as hard as you can for 20 seconds, say, you come out and you go straight back into your working set. It is brutal. But if you ever see on a bodybuilding stage when people are, they're shaking because they've got no connection. They've
--------------------------------------------------Summarized Chunk 1:
The text is a detailed exploration of training methods for hypertrophy and maintaining physique over time. The individual, an experienced fitness professional, shares 10 exercises. They are deadlifts, bench press, squats, hanging leg raise, incline dumbbell chest, dumbbell shoulder press, lying hamstring curl, seated calf raise, overhead tricep extension with a rope, and close grip pull-ups. The training techniques include compound lifts as well as isolation work. When performing hanging leg raises, there's an emphasis on avoiding building momentum, using hip flexors instead of the midsection, and focusing on contracting upper and lower abdominals before anything else, which illustrates a mind-to-muscle connection. The text also explores managing weights and bodyweight exercises, adjusting the exercises to personal preference and body response, and not following blindly what others recommend. The method of ISO holds and iso-tension are referenced for muscle control and tightening. This involves inhaling, exhaling all air, and holding a muscle contraction for a predetermined time period. The text also implies that one should treat their midsection like any other muscle, with proper rest and recovery periods. The importance of understanding one's own body and metabolism is emphasized, along with the need to balance anterior strength and back strength to avoid issues like slipped discs.

 got no control over their bicep. Is that why that happens? Yeah. Yeah. There's other, there's other factors what can happen. Dehydrated, they're tired, etc, etc. But nine times out of ten, that will be down to the fact they've not done any ISO holds or they've not took the time with their posing to practice the posing. And that's something I always pride in myself. And I remember the first few shows I did on the Olympia stage and we're all, we're all back hitting from the back and the guys are going, Ryan, how are you? How are you holding that? How are you holding that? Cause they're all, everyone's shaking. And it's because eight weeks out from any show, 30 minutes after my fasted cardio, I'll do ISO holds with every pose I have to do and every muscle group. So it's horrendous, but these are the things that people don't see. These are like, so when you look at bodybuilding, oh yeah, you eat some meals and you train twice a day, but it's the little things, it's the, what I obsess over because it's okay having a great work ethic, in the gym or having the discipline to eat your six meals and not cheat. But it's also the other bits of presentation, which is so important. What's happening, people? If you enjoyed that, then press here for the full unedited episode. And don't forget to subscribe.

--------------------------------------------------Summarized Chunk 2:
The speaker is discussing the importance of ISO holds and practicing posing in bodybuilding. They highlight that lack of control over body parts like the bicep during bodybuilding shows is often due to not performing adequate ISO holds or not spending enough time practicing their posing. They share their own regimen which includes doing ISO holds and practicing every pose he will have to perform, beginning 8 weeks before a show, following their fasted cardio. The speaker emphasizes the importance of paying attention to details like these, beyond the expected workouts and diet, that are critical to presentation in bodybuilding.

The man reveals that despite being a physically fit influencer, his followers are primarily men. He addresses the misconception that building a fitness-focused platform will attract women, while in reality, it often attracts more men. He suggests that rather than seeking female attention, one should work out for the love of it. Dealing with social media popularity and negativity, he copes by reminding himself that internet comments do not define him, and mutes notifications during intense fitness periods. He emphasizes that recognizing and healing personal insecurities matters more than reacting to other people's comments.

I'm sorry as I am an AI, I don't have any tattoos or the ability to see them. The text you provided appears to be a script for a podcast or interview where the speaker is discussing their relationship with their tattoos, expressing that they see them as a personal expression and prefer to keep them private to avoid distracting from the topics they discuss in their professional life. They also offer their view on the societal acceptance of tattoos and advise people to be aware of the potential impact permanent cosmetic changes may have on their life mission.
--------------------------------------------------Processed Raw Transcript:
It seems like you're trying to transcribe an interview, but some parts are not quite flowing. Here's a revision:

Q: Another thing that has carried over from your youth are your tattoos, which I've heard you talk about, but never seen. What's your relationship with your tattoos and why has no one ever seen them? 

A: Yeah, actually it was Tim Ferriss that outed me on this one. He was like, "I found a picture on the internet with you in full sleeves."

I believe that tattoos are a literal expression of what we feel on the inside. I started getting tattooed really young, around 14, and got my first tattoo. We did them ourselves, which I don't recommend. They were kind of unsightly and could lead to bad infections. 

Growing up skateboarding in the punk rock scene, I admired these guys in my town who all had full sleeves - they were into skateboarding and vehicles. I thought, "One day, I want full sleeves". So now, I've got full sleeves from neck to wrist, including my chest and back, nothing on my legs or stomach. 

Regarding why I prefer not to show them, there are a couple of reasons. I deeply care about putting the focus on the information I am conveying, not on my personal appearance. The tattoos can be distracting and don't relate to what I teach. Also, growing up the etiquette and general perception of tattoos were conservative, so I preferred keeping them formal, considerate and less visible.

I don't judge people based on their tattoos. But be aware, you can't control others' perceptions. Therefore, when considering permanent cosmetic changes, one should be thoughtful to ensure they align with, compete with or remain neutral to their life's mission. Mine in particular is teaching people about the beauty and utility of biology, and I intend to focus on that.

What are the 10 best exercises?
[HumanMessage(content='What are the 10 best exercises?\n', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]The user is asking for a list of the top 10 exercises that are considered the best. This could be in terms of overall health benefits, muscle building, fat burning, etc.
--------------------------------------------------Context:
["You are someone who has spent the last 20 years focusing on training, especially for hypertrophy. You are someone that has won pretty much every single title on the planet. You have 10 exercises that you can do for the rest of your life in order to maintain as good of a physique as you can. What are they and why? 10? That's very specific. 10. I just figured that that would be enough for you to get each different muscle group. Right, okay. So what are the longest levers that you can pull when it comes to", "If you only had 10 exercises for the rest of time, that's all you have in your library to stay as muscular as possible, give me the list. So the goal is to be as muscular as possible. Correct. Let's say I'm competing and I have 10 exercises. Sure. All right, sorry. I'm gonna have to count it on my hands. Squats. Why? Just overall leg growth, they help glutes. Quads, like a large portion of the leg that will really help. Barbell back squat. Super simple. If it's my whole life, I might actually do some", "top five exercises were step-ups or step-up variations. Step-up, cross body step-up, like. lateral step-up, something, something, something, and then maybe hex bar deadlift was in the sort of upper middle, deadlift another one, and then you get down toward like glute bridge kickback, and it's at 25, and I think it's 95 on this particular scale of this number, was step-up. So for anybody that wants to improve like lower body power, I just, I absolutely adore that movement, and it's so easy to do. We, you", "Let's say that for the rest of time, you only had 10 exercises to hold on to and grow as much muscle as you could. What would you choose and why? Inclined presses, no question about it. Dumbbell? Dumbbell, more than likely because, you know, it's just, you can do a lot with the dumbbells over the barbell, right? I always want that shelf up here. It looks great in t-shirts. And yeah, you know, if you're hitting a side shot, you want the upper pec development to exist. There's something about that angle", "we? Then we've got everything then. What's your number one bicep exercise? You know what I'm going to say? I'm going to say it, and this is a bit of an outward one this, because I've done loads of them today, is pull-ups. Close grip pull-ups. I know it's a back workout, but your second... muscle is bicep and the contraction I get off that for my bicep every week I hit them. I always want to bring my back up anyway so it's an excuse to just hit the back as well but I think that's a great overall exercise.", "down you crunch, you exhale every bit of air out, you crunch and hold it for three seconds as hard as you can. It's good to have your top off because you need to seriously tense. Do it again. Crunch. Try and do that ten times and then go to the side and then crunch down, hold and then do that ten times and then do that ten times. Have 30 seconds rest, go again and then go again. I do it five rounds and you're literally dripping wet through and the blood volume you get in your midsection is insane. So you", "out of the body and you crunch your abs as hard as you can for three seconds. Standing up? Standing up, yeah. You can do that with any muscle part. So it's the most monotonous thing a bodybuilder can do but it's one of the best things for muscle control, for getting everything tight, for condition. I challenge anybody to do this. So we'll keep it simple. Three from the front, three from the side. So you've got three on the obliques on either side. So you inhale, hands over your head, as you come down you", "9, yeah. Sometimes maybe as little as 7 on some things. Especially if you've had the shit night's sleep the night before. Yeah. What, when you're looking at movements, for instance, what was your session this morning? Can you remember in terms of exercises? Yeah, so I did floor presses. Dumbbells? Yep. I did pull downs. I did incline press. I did row. I did like incline curl, overhead tricep extension, and then a preacher curl. You know, it's not a true preacher bench, but hanging over a bench doing a", 'mill. You could use the step mill as the 10th exercise. And did you- I can carve- throughout the legs, I can do glutes with that. Did you ever do that weighted? Yeah, actually I did. I wore a weight vest for, what show was that? It was early in my career. I would wear like weight vests and I would wear like ankle weights. And I did something that no one else ever did. I was using E-STEM units while I was doing cardio. Like a Compex? Yeah, I used Compex, because I was sponsored by them for a while. So I was', "where we are now. Squat, bench, deadlift, hanging leg raise, incline chest press with dumbbells, shoulder press. Seated calf raise. Seated calf raise. Oh, so you wanna get the soleus moving. Yeah, we'll get them in. Okay. Okay. We'll cover them. And then two left. We need overhead tricep extension rope. Pivoted from the bottom of a pulley? Yeah. Right, okay, yeah. What are the cues that people get wrong there? Because this is something that I absolutely love to do, but where do people go wrong?", "comes to maintaining size or increasing size for the muscle group? A lot of obviously compound lifts. So you're looking at your deadlifts, your bench press and your squats. They're always good. Again, these are things that I've had to adapt over the years because of injuries and things, training silly when I was younger. Okay, there's three. There's three there. Hanging leg raise for core. It's one of the hardest midsection. If you do it properly, I think it's one of the hardest midsection exercises, but", "the weight training workouts are always 10 minutes or so of warmup. and then no more than 40 to 50 minutes of really hard work. If I do train hard any longer, I don't recover enough to be able to come in a few days later. And when I train that way, I generally make pretty consistent progress. And you're taking yourself up until what's that? Probably maybe 10, 30, 11 a.m., something like that. Yeah, and then I'll eat my first real meal. Now, occasionally I'll wake up really hungry if I didn't eat that well", "you end up doing this. You see guys, they come down and they're doing this. You see it. Why is that moving? Can I deactivate it? Sure. Right here, okay. Cool. Let's do that. So, okay. Oh. One-armed preachers. One-armed preacher curls. Dumbbells again? It could be on a machine or dumbbells, you know. Okay. But since we're gonna only have some dumbbells on a deserted island, we're gonna do that. You can use whatever you want. Yeah, so. You got the best gym in history, but you can only use 10 things. Preacher", "that. So you have to be careful, I think, with overloading it. Yes, because you can push it further than you can. Because you can push it further than you can really do it. So I know I did that, but I'm an extreme athlete, you know, with that. When it comes to the stepper, very, very popular cardio exercise for bodybuilders, what are people missing? What are they getting wrong when you see other people? They're holding on to the, they're hugging the damn thing. You know what they're also doing by doing it?", "two days off, something like that. Are you doing on the off days, are you doing some sort of zone three? Always jogging or skipping rope. Those are my favorite forms of cardio, sometimes swimming, but typically I'll go running for 30 to 45 minutes or if I'm feeling a little bit lazier, because I always find the high intensity stuff to be easier than the long drawn out stuff. I'll sometimes throw on a weight vest, a 30 or 50 pound. and weight vest and I'll go out for a shorter run or I'm a big fan of knees", "Yeah. You can do dumbbell? Yeah. Most people feel better with dumbbell because you can go in a position Okay, how many is that? That's four. That's four, yeah. Yeah, six left. This is gonna be hard without like, I'd like have to make a list of 20 and cut out. The autism is put to one side for now. We're doing this in our heads together. Dumbbell shoulder press. Uh-huh, seated. Seated. Yeah. Dumbbell shoulder press. Yeah, I think that'll help your triceps and shoulders a lot. Um. Maybe a close grip flat", "the side and not tell you about that. Okay, fine. You've still got three exercises. You only needed seven so far. Damn, did I say bent over row? No. Bent over row. Okay. That'll help like stability, the core as well. And then like lower back and obviously upper back. Yeah, because the only back exercise that you've had so far is the pull-up. Deadlifts and pull-ups. Yeah. Bent over rows. Yeah. Okay, yeah.

And that is generally the TLDR of the Trial of the Ancestors kind of mechanic that that's all you really have to do. Put the positions correctly, make sure you defend your base and attack the enemy's units, and that's pretty much all there is to it. So let's talk a little bit more about beefing up your team though and also acquiring new units. So when", "build is very much likely going to be excellent at the new league mechanic. And the reason for that is that it has access to artillery ballista totems. Not only that, depending on the variation you're playing, these totems can very much likely put out the majority of your single target damage, meaning you can put them down, dodge around, or do anything else that is required of you in any mechanic you're playing. The reason this is important is the new trial of the Ancestors League looks like it has rogue", "that's going to be around roughly 220 rounds. Now, unlike last time and my last video, I actually timed myself to the second. So it actually took exactly 8.13 hours to do these 32 tournaments. Now keep in mind, I was doing a much higher rank than last time. So it definitely was pretty challenging and I did die quite a lot. So that's why it took me a little bit longer than you might expect. Overall, we did get a good amount of loot, so the question is, how worth it is it to do Trial of the Ancestors,", "Yo what is up guys, Grim here and in today's video we're going to be answering a question about Trial of the Ancestors that has been floating around quite a lot. And the question is, do the rewards actually get better the higher rank you get? Do you get rarer tattoos? Do you get way more currency? Do you get all sorts of this stuff? Well, in my last video, I was at a poultry rank 450 and we found that the loot between the rank 450 and like 300 roughly, was pretty uninspiring. It wasn't too much to write", "and they will defend. So overall, those are the positions. So let's see how it actually plays out when I start a match. So the overall goal of Trial of the Ancestors, is to make sure that you kill all the enemies that you track down and you see. So we can see here some enemies. And then after you do that, you want to go ahead and try and destroy the enemy's base. So what is the enemy's base, and how do you destroy it? Well, you'll notice these totems here. This is essentially the enemy's base.

I'll be using all my own silver coins, and you guys can expect to see exactly how strong the Mechanic is and how to run it from the old Grimm here. But there's plenty of other strategies I would recommend as well. Maybe Expedition, Delirium Orbs, Delirium Mirrors, Harvest, The Works, probably more Blight is also very good for League Start. And you can find all of those. as well as these guides over on MaxwellGG, updated for 3.22, which I'll link down in the description if you want. Hope this, guys,", "So there is definitely things that you can do to get way, way more currency. However, the forfeit button isn't in yet, so that's why I wasn't doing that, but you can abuse that very heavily upcoming in a future patch here. But there is also a few other things to consider. And the main one I wanna share with you guys is the fact that you can get absurdly lucky in Trial of the Ancestors, and I did get absurdly lucky. I got a drop on Ram- of all rounds, which really was a game changer. And I decided not to", "build guides which need them and have these as a requirement, we may see some increases to prices. However, right now, I think we're starting to approach the reality of how these are actually going to be priced, and it's actually lower than higher than I was personally expecting. Now, there could be a few more reasons for this, but let's get into whether or not it. worth it to farm this mechanic with the lower prices here. All right, eight hours of Trial of the Ancestors, 1,000 to 1,400 Elo. Let's get into", "one video here. So, loot, how much can you get for going higher? And what is the current theory about this ranking scaling on loot? So the current theory is that most of the exceptionally rare drops that happen in Trial of the Ancestors actually happen only at higher ranks. So many people identified that certain tattoos, certain omens, and also the unique currency, Hinotora's Lock of Hair, they do not drop before a certain rank. Now, what is that rank? Well, people are theorizing that rank is ranked 500 to", "with whichever player you decide to go against, you will get different rewards. So it's pretty simple, pick the reward which is best, and overall the rewards do You scale as you complete more and more tournaments and you can complete and increase what is called your ranking. So your ranking basically determines what level of enemies you are versing and I think you start out around rank 150 and every tournament win you complete, you will get more and more ranking which will make the enemies harder and", "if there was any currency to be had. So let me quickly give you guys a bit of an idea of what I got from my runs and also how many I did. And then I'll talk about maybe what the future holds for the mechanic in terms of profitability. Okay, so this is two hours and 32 minutes and 31 seconds of farming the lead mechanic, trying really hard to make as much currency per hour as possible. is what I got. So overall, my strategy was to try and make it doable and fast to get through as many rounds as possible,", 'things which I have found to be able to allow you to influence the rewards past the you know overall picking the right one. So it is definitely a little bit restrictive in that front here, but keeping the people who have the valuable tattoos alive, and then going ahead and trying to maximize the amount of enemies that you have to choose from at one time are the two major points here. So to close out the video, I wanna talk a little bit more about how I see this mechanic developing in its current state', "sustain checked off on your list. So overall, this is what I'm going to be running at league start, and it is definitely something I recommend checking out for you guys as well. If you're interested in exactly how to allocate your points, here is the known most optimal way to do so. So you're gonna put your first point in here and travel all the way up to the center here. Then you're gonna go through the Keirak nodes, and then you're gonna go around here, grab all the map nodes here, go through the seventh", "get rounds done without doing any damage at all. It's really about how you position yourself and what units you take. A quick disclaimer here, though, I am playing a ranged bow character, so if you're playing something like melee or a proximity skill like RF, you may need to adjust a few things to suit your play style. There is also dedicated characters for Trial of the Ancestors, which we'll talk a little bit about at the end of the video, which are incredibly exploitative and can get around using some of", "and high ranking, so we're not going to get a definitive result of how profitable the mechanic is, but I think you should be able to get a pretty good idea of how much you could potentially make if everything lined up and you were blasting the thing at maximum efficiency here. So let's get into the loot and understand a little bit of how much we actually made here. Now a bit of a cliff note, if we take the information and the averages from my last video, for 59 tournaments it would have been roughly 407", "and you can really sell a lot in bulk and probably get a better price for them as well overall. I like strategies where you have an edge and this one definitely does seem to have one over people who don't know about it. So definitely very enticing. This strategy also has a pretty damn large amount of monster kills per hour, so you're likely gonna be getting a good amount of silver coins as well as sanctum books to sell on the open market, which can be pretty great if you're interested in the league", 'to be playing the mechanic, but honestly, I had quite a lot of fun doing it. So how much money did I make? Well, in raw non-exclusive rewards, I made 1,061 C here. So we got two divines, five annulments, and six exalts. Now, if we include the rewards that I actually lost from being washed up, being a bit of a fail whale here, I would have got an additional two divines and 10 instilling orbs, as well as three honored tattoos.

It's really about how you position yourself and what units you take. A quick disclaimer here, though, I am playing a ranged bow character, so if you're playing something like melee or a proximity skill like RF, you may need to adjust a few things to suit your play style. There is also dedicated characters for Trial of the Ancestors, which we'll talk a little bit about at the end of the video, which are incredibly exploitative and can get around using some of", "So there is definitely things that you can do to get way, way more currency. However, the forfeit button isn't in yet, so that's why I wasn't doing that, but you can abuse that very heavily upcoming in a future patch here. But there is also a few other things to consider. And the main one I wanna share with you guys is the fact that you can get absurdly lucky in Trial of the Ancestors, and I did get absurdly lucky. I got a drop on Ram- of all rounds, which really was a game changer. And I decided not to", "that's going to be around roughly 220 rounds. Now, unlike last time and my last video, I actually timed myself to the second. So it actually took exactly 8.13 hours to do these 32 tournaments. Now keep in mind, I was doing a much higher rank than last time. So it definitely was pretty challenging and I did die quite a lot. So that's why it took me a little bit longer than you might expect. Overall, we did get a good amount of loot, so the question is, how worth it is it to do Trial of the Ancestors,", "another reason why the base race strat is so good, because you can stun the totems the enemy is going to be respawning from. All right, so that should be pretty much it. Ancestral Totem goes down. That is an end game, a final match there at 1700, and how I play things. As a final little note here, I wanted to talk about a few builds, which I see being the strongest for this mechanic overall. So there's generally two different approaches you can take to this mechanic here. You can either play full damage,", "reason, Defenders are lowest on my list here. All right, now that that's out of the way, let me give you guys a few tips, which is gonna really put things into place and allow you to completely smash the mechanic. Tip number one. is that the enemy's commander will pretty much always move into your base immediately and stay there. And they're gonna bring all their escorts right there with them, and they will start trying to engage your units or start channeling on your totems. This can be very useful when", 'a way to do it. I will share with you guys all my findings on how to actually run the mechanic, maximize it, beat it really easy in those two minutes on average that I got in an upcoming video, but until then, hopefully you guys have enjoyed and learned something new here, and until next time, cheers.', "sustain checked off on your list. So overall, this is what I'm going to be running at league start, and it is definitely something I recommend checking out for you guys as well. If you're interested in exactly how to allocate your points, here is the known most optimal way to do so. So you're gonna put your first point in here and travel all the way up to the center here. Then you're gonna go through the Keirak nodes, and then you're gonna go around here, grab all the map nodes here, go through the seventh", "and all the options over on Maxwell GG after the league releases. But that's the general breakdown. Wandering Path into Legion's Stream of Consciousness, and then we're gonna transition into a full endgame Legion strat, if I decide to go for Legion. So the other strategy I'm strongly considering running is a 7th Gate Heist Essence Speed Farming strategy using Searing Exarch Altars. The general idea behind this strategy is to take any Tier 14 to 16 map that you've got, chisel it up, alch it, and blast it in", "league mechanic. Now comparing the two strats, I'm not sure which one I'm gonna go for yet. My gut is telling me that Heist Essence is likely gonna be the stronger pick earlier on in days one and two and a smoother transition. from the Wandering Path strategy, and it's likely gonna be more accessible to more builds if you're interested in going for it. It can also be pretty good because you do have that edge over players who don't know about Seventh Gate. But Legion is tried, it's true, and it's likely", "simple as that. Clearing Exarch and Eater of Worlds altars and slaying the boss at the end is the backbone of most currency strategies and a massive part of your earnings. So the faster you can churn through maps, the better, and Lightning Arrow is the king of that play style. In addition to that though, it's also fully capable and highly specialized at clearing all of the most profitable end game league mechanic farms in the game. Now some of the ones which I consider the strongest are Legion, Delirium,", "guys. But you can see an X down there, get him out of there. I wanna give you guys a bit of info on what I generally do when I've got downtime, though. So all these guys are respawning. We've got our totems killing everything in general here. But what I like to do is kind of hang around the back of the enemy's base. And whenever I see I've got a free second, I will start to click on an ancestor totem here and I'll just wear them down. But as soon as any enemy starts to come near me, I will of course move", "if there was any currency to be had. So let me quickly give you guys a bit of an idea of what I got from my runs and also how many I did. And then I'll talk about maybe what the future holds for the mechanic in terms of profitability. Okay, so this is two hours and 32 minutes and 31 seconds of farming the lead mechanic, trying really hard to make as much currency per hour as possible. is what I got. So overall, my strategy was to try and make it doable and fast to get through as many rounds as possible,", "damn good. So the first strategy I'm considering running, of course, is the tried, the true Legion. No surprise, but there's three big changes coming to Legion in patch 3.22. First and foremost, we have Legion as a Keurig modifier now, which is a massive increase to the profitability overall of this mechanic, but not just that, also the accessibility of the mechanic. You can get in and start doing multiple Legions per map without the need for Scarabs and Sextants, which is a big boost to its League spot"]

First and', "going for rewards. The next unit is the bird, the Thunderbird, which comes from Valarco, which is the shield here. The Thunderbird is absolutely crazy for offense.

And Nivali will always offer you one unit for 250. So the first thing you guys are", "put them where they belong because that will be better overall than putting. in another position.

And that is generally the TLDR of the Trial of the Ancestors kind of mechanic that that's all you really have to do. Put the positions correctly, make sure you defend your base and attack the enemy's units, and that's pretty much all there is to it. So let's talk a little bit more about beefing up your team though and also acquiring new units. So when", "Yo, what is up guys, Grim here, and in today's video, I'm gonna share with you guys all my day one Trial of the Ancestors findings. So first, I'm gonna give you guys an introduction of how I learned to run the mechanic and how I tried to maximize the efficiency. So in order to run Trial of the Ancestors, you will need some silver coins, but they are incredibly common even throughout the campaign and especially in maps as well. So common in fact, they're basically close to free if you try to buy them. So", "Yo, what is up guys, Grim here, and in today's video we've got a brand new huge patch for Trial of the Ancestors, which came out of nowhere, and it does exactly what we were hoping. It completely buffs the rewards of the League mechanic in a massive way. Completely invalidating my last two videos I might add, but that is completely fine. When they change the loot, and they buff it up, there's only one question that needs to be asked. How good is it? And of course, we need to answer that. So in this video,", "and they will defend. So overall, those are the positions. So let's see how it actually plays out when I start a match. So the overall goal of Trial of the Ancestors, is to make sure that you kill all the enemies that you track down and you see. So we can see here some enemies. And then after you do that, you want to go ahead and try and destroy the enemy's base. So what is the enemy's base, and how do you destroy it? Well, you'll notice these totems here. This is essentially the enemy's base. And for", "Yo, what is up, guys? Driv here, and in today's video, I'm gonna share with you guys every single thing I've learned about how to easily smash the Trial of the Ancestors mechanic. I'm gonna share with you guys the best units I've found, strategies, tactics, and overall way to run the mechanic so you don't fail, you get maximum rewards, and most importantly, you finish it fast. So I'm up around 1,700 rating here, and I can tell you that it's not about your character too much at all. You can actually get", "like an apothecary where you could but not very likely but then there's mechanics like ritual ritual you will eventually get lucky you will eventually get something ridiculous because there's a higher chance in those windows that there's gonna be something good and it feels like trial the ancestors is like that however there's a difference between this mechanic and ritual and that is that you get a pretty damn good baseline amount of loot in trial of the ancestors you get your stacks of divines exalts and", "It always has been, but it's probably a little bit less so now with the buffed rewards. So the question is, is Trial of the Ancestors worth farming? Well, I've got two questions for you. Do you enjoy the mechanic? If so, and you love it, absolutely, go ahead. There's pretty decent currency in there. You could get lucky, you could not get lucky. Overall, it's not gonna be as good as some other super competitive farming strats like Legion, Delirium, Magic Find, Expedition, et cetera, but it's definitely not", "them is a little bit annoying because they're so cheap, no one responds. But hopefully this has given you guys a little bit more info on Trial of the Ancestors. If you have any suggestions or questions, put them down below. I'll read them and respond to them, and then maybe use them in the next video. But hopefully you guys have enjoyed. Until next time, cheers.", "another reason why the base race strat is so good, because you can stun the totems the enemy is going to be respawning from. All right, so that should be pretty much it. Ancestral Totem goes down. That is an end game, a final match there at 1700, and how I play things. As a final little note here, I wanted to talk about a few builds, which I see being the strongest for this mechanic overall. So there's generally two different approaches you can take to this mechanic here. You can either play full damage,", "league mechanic. Now comparing the two strats, I'm not sure which one I'm gonna go for yet. My gut is telling me that Heist Essence is likely gonna be the stronger pick earlier on in days one and two and a smoother transition. from the Wandering Path strategy, and it's likely gonna be more accessible to more builds if you're interested in going for it. It can also be pretty good because you do have that edge over players who don't know about Seventh Gate. But Legion is tried, it's true, and it's likely", "tried, the true. Overall, a very good build. Lots of people are rocking this, and it's also very good for Trial of the Ancestors as well. So definitely not surprised to see Explosive Arrow there. It's definitely a very nice one there. Summon Raging Spirits is also present here. The Poison variant, as well as the Minion Instability version, but the Poison variant is definitely the one which most people are seeing the most play with here. Overall, definitely a pretty good one. Not too bad there, but you can", "all the enemies' totems while you are actually already attacking them with the artillery ballistas you have put down. So overall, phenomenal build. And if you're looking for a bit of a strategic re-roll, I think this is definitely one of the top picks I would recommend, personally. So next up is the other powerhouse of the league, the other hyped-up build, Hexblast Mines. Now, the version which I've seen to be the most effective and having the most success is the Korean Kalm's Heart Wrathpith Globe version", "not bad. And number two, do you like to gamble, specifically with your time? There's not really much of an expense to doing Trial of the Ancestors. Ancestors and there's not a whole lot of buy-in cost. But the thing that you have to value is your time. But if you do get lucky, the chances are that you will be able to make very good currency off Trial of the Ancestors. The baseline is there, and the carrot is there. So overall, I'm pretty happy with the state of rewards in Trial of the Ancestors, and I", "because I curious to see what kind of loot we could expect. And at rank 1,000, things certainly start to get a bit dicey. You certainly have to play a little bit differently, and I'll give you guys a full breakdown of how I actually smash this mechanic, even with my build, you know, in the next video. That's gonna be my final video on Trial of the Ancestors, most likely unless they change things. But this video is gonna be all about the high-ranking loot, because there's too much to talk about in one video", "it was. I'll be using all my own silver coins, and you guys can expect to see exactly how strong the Mechanic is and how to run it from the old Grimm here. But there's plenty of other strategies I would recommend as well. Maybe Expedition, Delirium Orbs, Delirium Mirrors, Harvest, The Works, probably more Blight is also very good for League Start. And you can find all of those. as well as these guides over on MaxwellGG, updated for 3.22, which I'll link down in the description if you want. Hope this, guys,", "Delirium, Mirrors or Orbs, Expedition or Blight. Now overall, Lightning Arrow completely obliterates all of these mechanics in league start viable gear, meaning it's going to be one of the top picks for choosing between any of these mechanics and being highly profitable. Overall, it's a. a complete beast at making currency, and it's definitely one I recommend if you've got a bit of experience playing bows, and if you wanna play any of these league mechanics at all, or variations on EXARC or either of", "simple as that. Clearing Exarch and Eater of Worlds altars and slaying the boss at the end is the backbone of most currency strategies and a massive part of your earnings. So the faster you can churn through maps, the better, and Lightning Arrow is the king of that play style. In addition to that though, it's also fully capable and highly specialized at clearing all of the most profitable end game league mechanic farms in the game. Now some of the ones which I consider the strongest are Legion, Delirium,", "So it's not built to be fair, unfortunately. So they definitely have a massive edge over you if you're playing fair. So you have to use the fact that you're a human and they're a computer to your advantage to win. All right, so next up is team building. Let me show you guys how I've been building my teams for really, really good success. So the first and most important position that I prioritize is the flanker position to try and get quick wins here. So I always put my fastest units in here. So a Tuatara", 'a bit of investigative work to see how people are actually playing them, and discuss them a little bit more. So overall, surprisingly, in endgame right now, the most played league starter is actually Lightning Arrow. Despite what a lot of people thought, with the nerf of Vengeance Cascade, Lightning Arrow Artillery Ballista is the most popular league start. Sitting here at 12% overall played, that is a staggering amount, and people are already starting to swap off Lightning Arrow to their other endgame', "and all the options over on Maxwell GG after the league releases. But that's the general breakdown. Wandering Path into Legion's Stream of Consciousness, and then we're gonna transition into a full endgame Legion strat, if I decide to go for Legion. So the other strategy I'm strongly considering running is a 7th Gate Heist Essence Speed Farming strategy using Searing Exarch Altars. The general idea behind this strategy is to take any Tier 14 to 16 map that you've got, chisel it up, alch it, and blast it in", "So overall, pretty damn interesting. Now the other big standout build here is Hexblast Mines. So Hexblast Mines have been floating around for a few leagues now, but this was the league where they really looked like they were gonna take off. And absolutely a lot of people are playing them and you can see here by the levels, a lot of people are having some success with it. Now overall, not as high as Lightning Arrow in terms of the overall levels, but you know, it's not a speed mapping build by any stretch", "made juicing no longer as strong. First and foremost, we saw the introduction of eldritch alters, and a buff to all Alcan-Go league mechanics, like Legion, Expedition, Blight, and they continue to get buffed, pushing players into getting more currency from speed farming strategies. That's point number one, and it is incredibly profitable to do these things. Alcan-Go Legion, Alcan-Go Blight, Alcan-Go Expedition, with alters, it's insane. So that's point number one. People have found better alternatives to", "That was in order of play rate right now on Peewee Ninja, levels 82 to 100. Let's dive a little bit more into the details and nitty gritty and see how people are actually playing these league starters then. All right, so first up, the superstar of the league, the one many people are playing, and the one I league started myself, actually is Lightning Arrow here, even after the nerf. And the variant which a lot of people are seeing a lot of success with is the Berserk version. I think both of the guides", "build guides which need them and have these as a requirement, we may see some increases to prices. However, right now, I think we're starting to approach the reality of how these are actually going to be priced, and it's actually lower than higher than I was personally expecting. Now, there could be a few more reasons for this, but let's get into whether or not it. worth it to farm this mechanic with the lower prices here.

What are the best units and strategies for the Trial of the ancestors league mechanic in poe 3.22[HumanMessage(content='What are the best units and strategies for the Trial of the ancestors league mechanic in poe 3.22', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]The user is asking for advice on the most effective characters (units) and tactics (strategies) to use for the "Trial of the Ancestors" league mechanic in the game Path of Exile (POE) version 3.22.["build is very much likely going to be excellent at the new league mechanic. And the reason for that is that it has access to artillery ballista totems. Not only that, depending on the variation you're playing, these totems can very much likely put out the majority of your single target damage, meaning you can put them down, dodge around, or do anything else that is required of you in any mechanic you're playing.

And that is generally the TLDR of the Trial of the Ancestors kind of mechanic that that's all you really have to do. Put the positions correctly, make sure you defend your base and attack the enemy's units, and that's pretty much all there is to it.

But there's plenty of other strategies I would recommend as well. Maybe Expedition, Delirium Orbs, Delirium Mirrors, Harvest, The Works, probably more Blight is also very good for League Start. And you can find all of those. as well as these guides over on MaxwellGG, updated for 3.22, which I'll link down in the description if you want. Hope this, guys,", "Yo, what is up guys, Grim here, and in today's video, I'm gonna share with you guys all my day one Trial of the Ancestors findings. So first, I'm gonna give you guys an introduction of how I learned to run the mechanic and how I tried to maximize the efficiency. So in order to run Trial of the Ancestors, you will need some silver coins, but they are incredibly common even throughout the campaign and especially in maps as well. So common in fact, they're basically close to free if you try to buy them. So", "damn good. So the first strategy I'm considering running, of course, is the tried, the true Legion.

So the other strategy I'm strongly considering running is a 7th Gate Heist Essence Speed Farming strategy using Searing Exarch Altars.

And then after you do that, you want to go ahead and try and destroy the enemy's base. So what is the enemy's base, and how do you destroy it? Well, you'll notice these totems here. This is essentially the enemy's base.

It completely buffs the rewards of the League mechanic in a massive way. Completely invalidating my last two videos I might add, but that is completely fine. When they change the loot, and they buff it up, there's only one question that needs to be asked. How good is it? And of course, we need to answer that. So in this video,", "all the enemies' totems while you are actually already attacking them with the artillery ballistas you have put down. So overall, phenomenal build.

So the question is, is Trial of the Ancestors worth farming? Well, I've got two questions for you. Do you enjoy the mechanic? If so, and you love it, absolutely, go ahead. There's pretty decent currency in there. You could get lucky, you could not get lucky. Overall, it's not gonna be as good as some other super competitive farming strats like Legion, Delirium, Magic Find, Expedition, et cetera, but it's definitely not", "like an apothecary where you could but not very likely but then there's mechanics like ritual ritual you will eventually get lucky you will eventually get something ridiculous because there's a higher chance in those windows that there's gonna be something good and it feels like trial the ancestors is like that however there's a difference between this mechanic and ritual and that is that you get a pretty damn good baseline amount of loot in trial of the ancestors you get your stacks of divines exalts and", 'as many mechanics which spawn monsters in it as you can, and multiplying everything as hard as you can with your Atlas passive tree and Scarabs.

                        Use this information in order to answer it: ["build is very much likely going to be excellent at the new league mechanic. And the reason for that is that it has access to artillery ballista totems. Not only that, depending on the variation you're playing, these totems can very much likely put out the majority of your single target damage, meaning you can put them down, dodge around, or do anything else that is required of you in any mechanic you're playing. The reason this is important is the new trial of the Ancestors League looks like it has rogue", "tide and make it so enemies kind of like have less of a presence and you will essentially just overwhelm them after some time and completely crush them. And that is generally the TLDR of the Trial of the Ancestors kind of mechanic that that's all you really have to do. Put the positions correctly, make sure you defend your base and attack the enemy's units, and that's pretty much all there is to it. So let's talk a little bit more about beefing up your team though and also acquiring new units. So when", "Yo, what is up, guys? Driv here, and in today's video, I'm gonna share with you guys every single thing I've learned about how to easily smash the Trial of the Ancestors mechanic. I'm gonna share with you guys the best units I've found, strategies, tactics, and overall way to run the mechanic so you don't fail, you get maximum rewards, and most importantly, you finish it fast. So I'm up around 1,700 rating here, and I can tell you that it's not about your character too much at all. You can actually get", "it was. I'll be using all my own silver coins, and you guys can expect to see exactly how strong the Mechanic is and how to run it from the old Grimm here. But there's plenty of other strategies I would recommend as well. Maybe Expedition, Delirium Orbs, Delirium Mirrors, Harvest, The Works, probably more Blight is also very good for League Start. And you can find all of those. as well as these guides over on MaxwellGG, updated for 3.22, which I'll link down in the description if you want. Hope this, guys,", "Yo, what is up guys, Grim here, and in today's video, I'm gonna share with you guys all my day one Trial of the Ancestors findings. So first, I'm gonna give you guys an introduction of how I learned to run the mechanic and how I tried to maximize the efficiency. So in order to run Trial of the Ancestors, you will need some silver coins, but they are incredibly common even throughout the campaign and especially in maps as well. So common in fact, they're basically close to free if you try to buy them. So", "damn good. So the first strategy I'm considering running, of course, is the tried, the true Legion. No surprise, but there's three big changes coming to Legion in patch 3.22. First and foremost, we have Legion as a Keurig modifier now, which is a massive increase to the profitability overall of this mechanic, but not just that, also the accessibility of the mechanic. You can get in and start doing multiple Legions per map without the need for Scarabs and Sextants, which is a big boost to its League spot", "and all the options over on Maxwell GG after the league releases. But that's the general breakdown. Wandering Path into Legion's Stream of Consciousness, and then we're gonna transition into a full endgame Legion strat, if I decide to go for Legion. So the other strategy I'm strongly considering running is a 7th Gate Heist Essence Speed Farming strategy using Searing Exarch Altars. The general idea behind this strategy is to take any Tier 14 to 16 map that you've got, chisel it up, alch it, and blast it in", "another reason why the base race strat is so good, because you can stun the totems the enemy is going to be respawning from. All right, so that should be pretty much it. Ancestral Totem goes down. That is an end game, a final match there at 1700, and how I play things. As a final little note here, I wanted to talk about a few builds, which I see being the strongest for this mechanic overall. So there's generally two different approaches you can take to this mechanic here. You can either play full damage,", "simple as that. Clearing Exarch and Eater of Worlds altars and slaying the boss at the end is the backbone of most currency strategies and a massive part of your earnings. So the faster you can churn through maps, the better, and Lightning Arrow is the king of that play style. In addition to that though, it's also fully capable and highly specialized at clearing all of the most profitable end game league mechanic farms in the game. Now some of the ones which I consider the strongest are Legion, Delirium,", "get rounds done without doing any damage at all. It's really about how you position yourself and what units you take. A quick disclaimer here, though, I am playing a ranged bow character, so if you're playing something like melee or a proximity skill like RF, you may need to adjust a few things to suit your play style. There is also dedicated characters for Trial of the Ancestors, which we'll talk a little bit about at the end of the video, which are incredibly exploitative and can get around using some of", "and they will defend. So overall, those are the positions. So let's see how it actually plays out when I start a match. So the overall goal of Trial of the Ancestors, is to make sure that you kill all the enemies that you track down and you see. So we can see here some enemies. And then after you do that, you want to go ahead and try and destroy the enemy's base. So what is the enemy's base, and how do you destroy it? Well, you'll notice these totems here. This is essentially the enemy's base. And for", "Yo, what is up guys, Grim here, and in today's video we've got a brand new huge patch for Trial of the Ancestors, which came out of nowhere, and it does exactly what we were hoping. It completely buffs the rewards of the League mechanic in a massive way. Completely invalidating my last two videos I might add, but that is completely fine. When they change the loot, and they buff it up, there's only one question that needs to be asked. How good is it? And of course, we need to answer that. So in this video,", "all the enemies' totems while you are actually already attacking them with the artillery ballistas you have put down. So overall, phenomenal build. And if you're looking for a bit of a strategic re-roll, I think this is definitely one of the top picks I would recommend, personally. So next up is the other powerhouse of the league, the other hyped-up build, Hexblast Mines. Now, the version which I've seen to be the most effective and having the most success is the Korean Kalm's Heart Wrathpith Globe version", "league mechanic. Now comparing the two strats, I'm not sure which one I'm gonna go for yet. My gut is telling me that Heist Essence is likely gonna be the stronger pick earlier on in days one and two and a smoother transition. from the Wandering Path strategy, and it's likely gonna be more accessible to more builds if you're interested in going for it. It can also be pretty good because you do have that edge over players who don't know about Seventh Gate. But Legion is tried, it's true, and it's likely", "tried, the true. Overall, a very good build. Lots of people are rocking this, and it's also very good for Trial of the Ancestors as well. So definitely not surprised to see Explosive Arrow there. It's definitely a very nice one there. Summon Raging Spirits is also present here. The Poison variant, as well as the Minion Instability version, but the Poison variant is definitely the one which most people are seeing the most play with here. Overall, definitely a pretty good one. Not too bad there, but you can", "It always has been, but it's probably a little bit less so now with the buffed rewards. So the question is, is Trial of the Ancestors worth farming? Well, I've got two questions for you. Do you enjoy the mechanic? If so, and you love it, absolutely, go ahead. There's pretty decent currency in there. You could get lucky, you could not get lucky. Overall, it's not gonna be as good as some other super competitive farming strats like Legion, Delirium, Magic Find, Expedition, et cetera, but it's definitely not", "like an apothecary where you could but not very likely but then there's mechanics like ritual ritual you will eventually get lucky you will eventually get something ridiculous because there's a higher chance in those windows that there's gonna be something good and it feels like trial the ancestors is like that however there's a difference between this mechanic and ritual and that is that you get a pretty damn good baseline amount of loot in trial of the ancestors you get your stacks of divines exalts and", 'as many mechanics which spawn monsters in it as you can, and multiplying everything as hard as you can with your Atlas passive tree and Scarabs. Now, this is a strategy which is still used here and there, but used to be one of the main strategies that people used in endgame. Right now, people farm Crimson Temple for Apothecaries, and they use Delirium mobs to get a ton of Delirium rewards overall, and they kind of do that. But both of those kind of require an insane character in endgame, and have', "Delirium, Mirrors or Orbs, Expedition or Blight. Now overall, Lightning Arrow completely obliterates all of these mechanics in league start viable gear, meaning it's going to be one of the top picks for choosing between any of these mechanics and being highly profitable. Overall, it's a. a complete beast at making currency, and it's definitely one I recommend if you've got a bit of experience playing bows, and if you wanna play any of these league mechanics at all, or variations on EXARC or either of", "around with stuff on the field as well. As a bit of a bonus, this build is likely gonna be good for all the new keystones coming as well, specifically the new Expedition one, which will have you blow up remnants all over the place and even though there's a lot of immunity remnants, this build doesn't care because it does tri-elemental damage in the form of fire, lightning, and cold damage, meaning you can run the new Expedition keystone without too many downsides, a big plus if you're interested in that.", "So overall, pretty damn interesting. Now the other big standout build here is Hexblast Mines. So Hexblast Mines have been floating around for a few leagues now, but this was the league where they really looked like they were gonna take off. And absolutely a lot of people are playing them and you can see here by the levels, a lot of people are having some success with it. Now overall, not as high as Lightning Arrow in terms of the overall levels, but you know, it's not a speed mapping build by any stretch", "made juicing no longer as strong. First and foremost, we saw the introduction of eldritch alters, and a buff to all Alcan-Go league mechanics, like Legion, Expedition, Blight, and they continue to get buffed, pushing players into getting more currency from speed farming strategies. That's point number one, and it is incredibly profitable to do these things. Alcan-Go Legion, Alcan-Go Blight, Alcan-Go Expedition, with alters, it's insane. So that's point number one. People have found better alternatives to", "one maps all the way to Exarch and Eda completely solo self-found. And in trade league, you can also use trade to make that even easier. Some players are reporting pretty incredible solo self-found runs with this build. Using the new wandering path atlas passive tree technology, which came out a few leagues ago, people are going from Twilight Strand all the way to Exarch and Eda in roughly 10 hours or less. That's killing both those bosses in 10 hours or less. That's incredible. And that's all in solo", "our map pool and progress our map tiers. This is so that you can generate currency while also making progress towards Eater and Exarch. And this is a pretty good strategy still if you have a build which needs a bit of currency in order to get going. But if you're playing a build which doesn't really need much currency at all, like Lightning Arrow, which is fully capable of going all the way from Twilight Strand to killing Eater and Exarch in solo self-found gear and fall links, the strategy I'm about to", "because I curious to see what kind of loot we could expect. And at rank 1,000, things certainly start to get a bit dicey. You certainly have to play a little bit differently, and I'll give you guys a full breakdown of how I actually smash this mechanic, even with my build, you know, in the next video. That's gonna be my final video on Trial of the Ancestors, most likely unless they change things. But this video is gonna be all about the high-ranking loot, because there's too much to talk about in one video"] \n

So overall, the best approach really is kill all the enemy's enemies, protect your base by knocking them out, and then allow your units to do all the channeling because you have so many of them and they will essentially dog pile the enemy's totems and completely wipe out their base. Generally, the first few totems that you knock out are the most important because they overall will kind of turn the tide and make it so enemies kind of like have less of a presence and you will essentially just overwhelm them after some time and completely crush them.

The reason this is important is the new trial of the Ancestors League looks like it has rogue exile style enemies with massive telegraphed attacks. The cool thing about this is that those types of enemies generally like to go for totems, meaning they won't be attacking and targeting you the whole time. In addition to that, all you need to do to achieve most of your damage is put your totems down and run away, giving you ample time to deal with any unknown mechanics or giving you a lot more time to dodge ones you know are coming. It'll also give you the potential upside of messing around with stuff on the field as well. As a bit of a bonus, this build is likely gonna be good for all the new keystones coming as well, specifically the new Expedition one, which will have", "So attackers go for the enemy's units. The flank. go for the enemy's base, and the escorts are generally trying to help you. And I generally try and put supportive units or casters in the escort position here, because they have a lot of crowd control and things like that. So this unit here, throws cold spells from a distance, is a pretty good example of that, they do a big cold wave. And then finally, the last position here, Defender, is essentially a position where you can put units in, and they will just literally sit in your base. And if the enemy tries to attack your base, they will sit there, and they will defend. So overall, those are the positions. So let's see how it actually plays out when I start a match. So the overall goal of Trial of the Ancestors, is to make sure that you kill all the enemies that you track down and you see. So we can see here some enemies. And then after you do that, you want to go ahead and try and destroy the enemy's base. So what is the enemy's base,", "Gate. But Legion is tried, it's true, and it's likely going to be a complete endgame monster, and it just scales so insanely in the economy into endgame, thanks to stuff like incubators, the Legion sets, and all sorts of stuff. And of course, Kirak modifier on the map dives for Legion is just insane as well. So I'd probably go Heist Essence early for the advantage, or I'd go Legion if you wanna scale late, that would be my decision. Now, overall, I will also be running the League Mechanic and experimenting with it, of course, to see how profitable it was. I'll be using all my own silver coins, and you guys can expect to see exactly how strong the Mechanic is and how to run it from the old Grimm here. But there's plenty of other strategies I would recommend as well. Maybe Expedition, Delirium Orbs, Delirium Mirrors, Harvest, The Works, probably more Blight is also very good for League Start.

Now after doing that, if you want to play the mechanic straight away and you don't care about lore or anything like that, hightail it all the way down here to the Eye of Destiny. So once you get here, you'll be able to engage in combat and start a match, and depending on which match you decide to try and start", "get our dunes map pull up and going, scarabs should start to be on the market and we can start to use scarabs as well.

Overall, it's a great play style, a lot of fun, doesn't require you to go get a bunch of favorites, and", "very good for Trial of the Ancestors as well. So definitely not surprised to see Explosive Arrow there. It's definitely a very nice one there. Summon Raging Spirits is also present here. The Poison variant, as well as the Minion Instability version, but the Poison variant is definitely the one which most people are seeing the most play with here. Overall, definitely a pretty good one. Not too bad there, but you can see here on the overall levels, a little bit lower than some of the other builds so definitely a little bit slower on the clear speed or a little bit more squishy in terms of survivability. Now, this is one that was particularly surprising for me, and that is Exsanguinate. So it comes in two different packages. There is the self-cast Exsanguinate build, which is generally played on Pathfinder, but then there is also the Exsanguinate Trapper played with Seismic Trap. So there is two different variants of Exsanguinate. It actually does seem that a lot of people are going", "is, is Trial of the Ancestors worth farming? Well, I've got two questions for you. Do you enjoy the mechanic? If so, and you love it, absolutely, go ahead. There's pretty decent currency in there. You could get lucky, you could not get lucky. Overall, it's not gonna be as good as some other super competitive farming strats like Legion, Delirium, Magic Find, Expedition, et cetera, but it's definitely not bad. And number two, do you like to gamble, specifically with your time? There's not really much of an expense to doing Trial of the Ancestors. Ancestors and there's not a whole lot of buy-in cost. But the thing that you have to value is your time. But if you do get lucky, the chances are that you will be able to make very good currency off Trial of the Ancestors. The baseline is there, and the carrot is there. So overall, I'm pretty happy with the state of rewards in Trial of the Ancestors, and I definitely don't feel like I'm wasting my time at all. And the number one question I have", "as Heist Essence, one of them using Seventh Gate. After you finish the base Wandering Path tree, you might be a little bit confused where to put your remaining Atlas Passive points. My recommendation and what I'm going to do is to start specking into the Atlas Passive tree you plan to farm in end game. So for example, if it was Legion, you could start taking the Legion nodes. And overall, once you have a suitable map pool and XR can eat a dead. you can begin respeccing the Wandering Path nodes and then fully transitioning into the strategy you want to actually run. And of course, you're already going to be most of the way there because you'll be putting all your spare points in it and that's going to be pretty damn good. So the first strategy I'm considering running, of course, is the tried, the true Legion. No surprise, but there's three big changes coming to Legion in patch 3.22. First and foremost, we have Legion as a Keurig modifier now, which is a massive increase to the", "get a better price for them as well overall. I like strategies where you have an edge and this one definitely does seem to have one over people who don't know about it. So definitely very enticing. This strategy also has a pretty damn large amount of monster kills per hour, so you're likely gonna be getting a good amount of silver coins as well as sanctum books to sell on the open market, which can be pretty great if you're interested in the league mechanic. Now comparing the two strats, I'm not sure which one I'm gonna go for yet. My gut is telling me that Heist Essence is likely gonna be the stronger pick earlier on in days one and two and a smoother transition. from the Wandering Path strategy, and it's likely gonna be more accessible to more builds if you're interested in going for it.

Now overall, Lightning Arrow completely obliterates all of these mechanics in league start viable gear, meaning it's going to be one of the top picks for choosing between any of these mechanics and being highly profitable.

As a final little note here, I wanted to talk about a few builds, which I see being the strongest for this mechanic overall. So there's generally two different approaches you can take to this mechanic here. You can either play full damage, in the case that you kind of do maximum damage and you kill all the enemy units, or you can go ahead and do Z DPS and focus on crowd control. So as I mentioned earlier, units respawn very quickly from the totem. So if you're killing them, you have to be killing them fast to make sure they're all down. But if you do do that, well, your allies are basically just going to be able to fully channel on all the totems and they'll have nothing to"] \n

So common in fact, they're basically close to free if you try to buy them. So when you use a silver coin, you'll get a portal to the Halls of the Dead, and after you get into the Halls of the Dead, all you have to do is interact with the Well of Passing. Now after doing that, if you want to play the mechanic straight away and you don't care about lore or anything like that, hightail it all the way down here to the Eye of Destiny. So once you get here, you'll be able to engage in combat and start a match, and depending on which match you decide to try and start", "get our dunes map pull up and going, scarabs should start to be on the market and we can start to use scarabs as well. Now, this strategy is an end game legion strategy here, this tree, and you can find a full breakdown of how it works and all the options over on Maxwell GG after the league releases. But that's the general breakdown. Wandering Path into Legion's Stream of Consciousness, and then we're gonna transition into a full endgame Legion strat, if I decide to go for Legion. So the other strategy I'm strongly considering running is a 7th Gate Heist Essence Speed Farming strategy using Searing Exarch Altars. The general idea behind this strategy is to take any Tier 14 to 16 map that you've got, chisel it up, alch it, and blast it in there with Heist Tier Arc Modifier on there, click on all the caches, click on all the essences, kill the boss, get out of there, and do more maps. Overall, it's a great play style, a lot of fun, doesn't require you to go get a bunch of favorites, and", "very good for Trial of the Ancestors as well. So definitely not surprised to see Explosive Arrow there. It's definitely a very nice one there. Summon Raging Spirits is also present here. The Poison variant, as well as the Minion Instability version, but the Poison variant is definitely the one which most people are seeing the most play with here. Overall, definitely a pretty good one. Not too bad there, but you can see here on the overall levels, a little bit lower than some of the other builds so definitely a little bit slower on the clear speed or a little bit more squishy in terms of survivability. Now, this is one that was particularly surprising for me, and that is Exsanguinate. So it comes in two different packages. There is the self-cast Exsanguinate build, which is generally played on Pathfinder, but then there is also the Exsanguinate Trapper played with Seismic Trap. So there is two different variants of Exsanguinate. It actually does seem that a lot of people are going", "is, is Trial of the Ancestors worth farming? Well, I've got two questions for you. Do you enjoy the mechanic? If so, and you love it, absolutely, go ahead. There's pretty decent currency in there. You could get lucky, you could not get lucky. Overall, it's not gonna be as good as some other super competitive farming strats like Legion, Delirium, Magic Find, Expedition, et cetera, but it's definitely not bad. And number two, do you like to gamble, specifically with your time? There's not really much of an expense to doing Trial of the Ancestors. Ancestors and there's not a whole lot of buy-in cost. But the thing that you have to value is your time. But if you do get lucky, the chances are that you will be able to make very good currency off Trial of the Ancestors. The baseline is there, and the carrot is there. So overall, I'm pretty happy with the state of rewards in Trial of the Ancestors, and I definitely don't feel like I'm wasting my time at all. And the number one question I have", "as Heist Essence, one of them using Seventh Gate. After you finish the base Wandering Path tree, you might be a little bit confused where to put your remaining Atlas Passive points. My recommendation and what I'm going to do is to start specking into the Atlas Passive tree you plan to farm in end game. So for example, if it was Legion, you could start taking the Legion nodes. And overall, once you have a suitable map pool and XR can eat a dead. you can begin respeccing the Wandering Path nodes and then fully transitioning into the strategy you want to actually run. And of course, you're already going to be most of the way there because you'll be putting all your spare points in it and that's going to be pretty damn good. So the first strategy I'm considering running, of course, is the tried, the true Legion. No surprise, but there's three big changes coming to Legion in patch 3.22. First and foremost, we have Legion as a Keurig modifier now, which is a massive increase to the", "get a better price for them as well overall. I like strategies where you have an edge and this one definitely does seem to have one over people who don't know about it. So definitely very enticing. This strategy also has a pretty damn large amount of monster kills per hour, so you're likely gonna be getting a good amount of silver coins as well as sanctum books to sell on the open market, which can be pretty great if you're interested in the league mechanic. Now comparing the two strats, I'm not sure which one I'm gonna go for yet. My gut is telling me that Heist Essence is likely gonna be the stronger pick earlier on in days one and two and a smoother transition. from the Wandering Path strategy, and it's likely gonna be more accessible to more builds if you're interested in going for it. It can also be pretty good because you do have that edge over players who don't know about Seventh Gate. But Legion is tried, it's true, and it's likely going to be a complete endgame monster, and", "It's as simple as that. Clearing Exarch and Eater of Worlds altars and slaying the boss at the end is the backbone of most currency strategies and a massive part of your earnings. So the faster you can churn through maps, the better, and Lightning Arrow is the king of that play style. In addition to that though, it's also fully capable and highly specialized at clearing all of the most profitable end game league mechanic farms in the game. Now some of the ones which I consider the strongest are Legion, Delirium, Mirrors or Orbs, Expedition or Blight. Now overall, Lightning Arrow completely obliterates all of these mechanics in league start viable gear, meaning it's going to be one of the top picks for choosing between any of these mechanics and being highly profitable. Overall, it's a. a complete beast at making currency, and it's definitely one I recommend if you've got a bit of experience playing bows, and if you wanna play any of these league mechanics at all, or variations on", "them from starting to respawn. It's also another reason why the base race strat is so good, because you can stun the totems the enemy is going to be respawning from. All right, so that should be pretty much it. Ancestral Totem goes down. That is an end game, a final match there at 1700, and how I play things. As a final little note here, I wanted to talk about a few builds, which I see being the strongest for this mechanic overall. So there's generally two different approaches you can take to this mechanic here. You can either play full damage, in the case that you kind of do maximum damage and you kill all the enemy units, or you can go ahead and do Z DPS and focus on crowd control. So as I mentioned earlier, units respawn very quickly from the totem. So if you're killing them, you have to be killing them fast to make sure they're all down. But if you do do that, well, your allies are basically just going to be able to fully channel on all the totems and they'll have nothing to"] \n

                        Here is the previous conversation history: [HumanMessage(content='What are the best units and strategies for the Trial of the ancestors league mechanic in poe 3.22, im specifically talking about escorters defenders attackers and flankers', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]

                        Here is what the user is really asking about: The user is asking for advice on the best units to use and strategies to employ for the "Trial of the Ancestors" league mechanic in the game Path of Exile version 3.22. They are specifically interested in the roles of escorters, defenders, attackers, and flankers within this game mechanic. 
 +
                        Use this information in order to answer it: ["So attackers go for the enemy's units. The flank. go for the enemy's base, and the escorts are generally trying to help you. And I generally try and put supportive units or casters in the escort position here, because they have a lot of crowd control and things like that. So this unit here, throws cold spells from a distance, is a pretty good example of that, they do a big cold wave. And then finally, the last position here, Defender, is essentially a position where you can put units in, and they will just literally sit in your base. And if the enemy tries to attack your base, they will sit there, and they will defend. So overall, those are the positions. So let's see how it actually plays out when I start a match. So the overall goal of Trial of the Ancestors, is to make sure that you kill all the enemies that you track down and you see. So we can see here some enemies. And then after you do that, you want to go ahead and try and destroy the enemy's base. So what is the enemy's base,", "Yo, what is up, guys? Driv here, and in today's video, I'm gonna share with you guys every single thing I've learned about how to easily smash the Trial of the Ancestors mechanic. I'm gonna share with you guys the best units I've found, strategies, tactics, and overall way to run the mechanic so you don't fail, you get maximum rewards, and most importantly, you finish it fast. So I'm up around 1,700 rating here, and I can tell you that it's not about your character too much at all. You can actually get rounds done without doing any damage at all. It's really about how you position yourself and what units you take. A quick disclaimer here, though, I am playing a ranged bow character, so if you're playing something like melee or a proximity skill like RF, you may need to adjust a few things to suit your play style. There is also dedicated characters for Trial of the Ancestors, which we'll talk a little bit about at the end of the video, which are incredibly exploitative and can get", "is a massive penalty for trying to attack the enemy's base or when the enemy attacks your base and they get hit. So overall, the best approach really is kill all the enemy's enemies, protect your base by knocking them out, and then allow your units to do all the channeling because you have so many of them and they will essentially dog pile the enemy's totems and completely wipe out their base. Generally, the first few totems that you knock out are the most important because they overall will kind of turn the tide and make it so enemies kind of like have less of a presence and you will essentially just overwhelm them after some time and completely crush them. And that is generally the TLDR of the Trial of the Ancestors kind of mechanic that that's all you really have to do. Put the positions correctly, make sure you defend your base and attack the enemy's units, and that's pretty much all there is to it. So let's talk a little bit more about beefing up your team though and also", "part, they're going straight into your base. Meaning the only four units left to defend the enemy's base in the entirety of the game is their defenders. Now, if you can crowd control them, kill them, or just distract them enough that your flankers and your escorts, if you have any, can kill the enemy's totems, it's over. They're going to lose very quickly, and as long as you're not losing a ton of units back at your base, it's done. Now, the one thing which can hinder this strategy and mess it up is, of course, if you die on the way, because all of your escorts, upon dying, will move back to your base, and you'll be in a defensive position in which you can be in a bit of trouble, and you can start losing a lot of totems, because as I mentioned, your team is always unconditionally weaker than the opponent's, so you will lose in a battle of attrition if you're on the floor, and you don't have any insane team compositions. But we'll get to that. So overall, this is by far the best", "could not win the game. It would be impossible unless you had a flanker or attacker still alive. So for that reason, Defenders are lowest on my list here. All right, now that that's out of the way, let me give you guys a few tips, which is gonna really put things into place and allow you to completely smash the mechanic. Tip number one. is that the enemy's commander will pretty much always move into your base immediately and stay there. And they're gonna bring all their escorts right there with them, and they will start trying to engage your units or start channeling on your totems. This can be very useful when you're trying to think up strategies and tactics, and we're gonna use this in a second here. Tip number two, the enemy will pretty much always unconditionally be stronger than you. This is round one here, and you can see that all of the enemy's units here are just gonna be way better than mine, and they just are worth way more favor, which is the currency you get to buy units.", "you're playing, these totems can very much likely put out the majority of your single target damage, meaning you can put them down, dodge around, or do anything else that is required of you in any mechanic you're playing. The reason this is important is the new trial of the Ancestors League looks like it has rogue exile style enemies with massive telegraphed attacks. The cool thing about this is that those types of enemies generally like to go for totems, meaning they won't be attacking and targeting you the whole time. In addition to that, all you need to do to achieve most of your damage is put your totems down and run away, giving you ample time to deal with any unknown mechanics or giving you a lot more time to dodge ones you know are coming. It'll also give you the potential upside of messing around with stuff on the field as well. As a bit of a bonus, this build is likely gonna be good for all the new keystones coming as well, specifically the new Expedition one, which will have", "over any other unit. If you have more Caldera Ravagers than that, for whatever reason, you can put some in Defender. Next up and last up is going to be the Spearfisher. So the Spearfisher should always go in Defender. And once you have four of them, you don't need to buy any more of them because they are primarily at Defender. And you can start moving favor from that vendor over to another one. Now, in terms of every other unit, we've already talked about that. Put any bulky units in the front, put any fast units in the flank position like the Tuatara, and put any garbage Nivala units or units which you're not a big fan of in the Escort position because Escort is only going to be there for channeling Totems. This is pretty much where you put all of the Dregs. And anything in Defender should try to be a ranged unit or a bulky unit. All right, I wanna give you guys a few tips on enemies here so you can avoid some pretty rough encounters. So there are three enemy types which I find to be", "is the most important position. It is the flanter position. The flanter position is going to completely ignore everything in the entirety of the game, other than the enemy's totems. They're going to make a beeline straight for the enemy's base, and they will mindlessly channel on totems. Even if they are going to die, they will continue to try and attempt to channel the totems. So the most important role is this one, because these are directly associated with how fast you will kill the enemy. Have better flanters, enemy dies faster. It's as simple as that. And prioritising getting the best flanters... in the game from the shops is one of the fastest ways to improve your clear speed and overall success rate. So flankers are definitely super important, but they're incredibly silly, so they're not gonna help you defend or really anything else other than kill the enemy base quickly. The next position is also very powerful, but it works a little bit differently. The escort position units", "Horn and the Fieldmaster here. So these guys are all gonna go and try ahead and destroy the enemy's base. Now, the next position I generally try and fill out is the attacker and escort position. So I generally put all my melee fighters who are intended to be doing damage or interacting with the enemy in the front here. So tanks, guys who do kind of any sort of melee attack, anything like that. And I generally put all my casters in the escort kind of position here. So the attacker position is generally just gonna bash into the enemy's units here. I don't really think that they kind of prioritize going ahead and destroying the enemy's base. They generally focus on killing the enemy's units. And the escort position here, I believe, I'm not 100% sure, but I believe they try and assist you and move wherever you are. That is what I think that they do. So they're kind of tied to you as a player. So attackers go for the enemy's units. The flank. go for the enemy's base, and the escorts are", "be more protected. Now, this guy, you wanna put him on flanker first and foremost, but if you've got flankers full, put him on attacker. If attackers are full, put him on defender. This is, in my opinion, the best unit in the game because he's both an offensive unit and a defensive unit, and overall, just an absolute powerhouse. The games where I have like four field masters versus the ones where I have none is like night and day. This guy, try him out, give him a go, he's crazy. And prioritize favor wherever you can on the board when you're going for rewards. The next unit is the bird, the Thunderbird, which comes from Valarco, which is the shield here. The Thunderbird is absolutely crazy for offense. It's by far the best offensive unit in the game, and the reason for that is that first and foremost, it's incredibly fast. This thing's basically got a mage blood on it. In addition to that, it also lightning warps, but it has no cast time, so it immediately, BAM, will teleport across", "you've got a few things that you're going to have to consider. First and foremost, what units do you have? And also what on earth are you going to put on the board here? So I generally completely ignore my enemy. I don't know if that's correct, but I haven't had any issues so far. But overall, here's what I do. So you can see that there's four different positions. There is defender, there is escort, and there is attacker and flanker. So the most important thing to realize here is this is essentially kind of different ways that you can use your units. So for example, the flanker position. if you put a unit here, they will pretty much always ignore all the enemy's NPCs and they will go around the field and start attacking the enemy's base, pretty much ignoring any sort of enemy unit. Now, overall, that's the position I think is actually most valuable because you as a player can defend the base and you as a player can also attack the enemy and sweep up their units. However, what you", "Gate. But Legion is tried, it's true, and it's likely going to be a complete endgame monster, and it just scales so insanely in the economy into endgame, thanks to stuff like incubators, the Legion sets, and all sorts of stuff. And of course, Kirak modifier on the map dives for Legion is just insane as well. So I'd probably go Heist Essence early for the advantage, or I'd go Legion if you wanna scale late, that would be my decision. Now, overall, I will also be running the League Mechanic and experimenting with it, of course, to see how profitable it was. I'll be using all my own silver coins, and you guys can expect to see exactly how strong the Mechanic is and how to run it from the old Grimm here. But there's plenty of other strategies I would recommend as well. Maybe Expedition, Delirium Orbs, Delirium Mirrors, Harvest, The Works, probably more Blight is also very good for League Start. And you can find all of those. as well as these guides over on MaxwellGG, updated for 3.22,", "in the flank position, then go and prioritise attacker, and then finally prioritise escort. And then if you have any units left over, go for defender. That is my overall guidance on that one. Now, when you're in a fight though, why am I saying that it's so hard for a player to attack, even though it might not be as efficient? Well, if you go ahead and come up here and you try and attack an enemy totem, and you're kind of start channeling, you're like, I'm gonna kill this here. An enemy, if they hit you, will actually stun you for an incredibly long time here. Death draw, five second stun. So if you get hit at all by anything, even if they sneeze on you, they will stun you, which is obviously a disaster. And of course, enemies can come and attack your totems as well. But it also goes for them. If you hit them while they're trying to channel your totems, you will also stun them. so there is a massive penalty for trying to attack the enemy's base or when the enemy attacks your base and"] \n

Reason number two, or point number two here, is five-way farming did get nerfed. So the five-way XP boosting meta is definitely going to be substantially hindered. And that affects us because we were the overall suppliers of the five-way. 5-way emblems to those players. So if they're nerfed, we in theory are nerfed as well. However, I'm not overly concerned about this because 5-way boosting is still likely going to be the best way to power level other players.

But of course, this build. can fully take advantage of all the Atlas passive cheese that we know and love as well. The first one being Packed with Energy here, a special node on the tree that whenever you pick up a Sulphite Vein or chest, you'll get a buff, which gives you a ton of movement speed, damage, and max res.

Those are the two things which I would personally recommend and farm on this build. Maybe even some Guardian Invitation rotations, but probably Sanctum is the thing I personally would run.

Clearing Exarch and Eater of Worlds altars and slaying the boss at the end is the backbone of most currency strategies and a massive part of your earnings. So the faster you can churn through maps, the better, and Lightning Arrow is the king of that play style. In addition to that though, it's also fully capable and highly specialized at clearing all of the most profitable end game league mechanic farms in the game. Now some of the ones which I consider the strongest are Legion, Delirium, Mirrors or Orbs, Expedition or Blight. Now overall, Lightning Arrow completely obliterates all of these mechanics in league start viable gear, meaning it's going to be one of the top picks for choosing between any of these mechanics and being highly profitable. Overall, it's a. a complete beast at making currency, and it's definitely one I recommend if you've got a bit of experience playing bows, and if you wanna play any of these league mechanics at all, or variations on", "map pool. Very, very nice indeed. So that's what I'm gonna be doing to progress my Atlas quickly, and it's gonna take me all the way up to getting Exarch and Eater of World Ultis online and ready. to go. So after I kill the Sirian Exarch and Eater of Worlds with the Wandering Path strategy, I'm going to stick with it for a little bit longer. I'm going to use the Wandering Path strategy and the infinite sustain that comes with it to build up a tier 16 map pool. I think I'm going to be aiming for around 20 to 30 tier 16 maps, but after that, I'm going to swap to a new Atlas Passive strategy, which focuses on making currency making instead of progression. I've got two different trees, which I'm currently debating which one I want to go for. And I think I'm going to decide in the moment, depending on the prices that I'm going to be looking at. I'm going to be deciding between Legion as well as Heist Essence, one of them using Seventh Gate. After you finish the base Wandering Path tree,"] \n
