Shashank Kalanithi provides a guide to get started with freelancing as a data analyst or a data scientist. Freelancing can include hourly or project-based work generally outside regular working hours. Online platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are popular for this. According to Shashank, roles like data analysts and data scientists have unique skills that are easy to market and sell by the hour. 

The structure of his guidance includes:

1. Definition and benefits of freelancing.
2. Reasons for choosing and using Upwork for freelancing.
3. Tips for kick-starting your Upwork profile and writing excellent proposals.
4. Methods for managing clients and regarding how much to charge.
5. Why he quit freelancing and caution area for those considering freelancing.

According to Shashank, the three main benefits of freelancing are 1) an additional source of income, 2) an opportunity to improve technical and non-technical skills, such as stakeholder management, and 3) added income security. Interestingly, freelancing also allows exposure and learning opportunities with technologies overlooked in traditional employment roles.
 The speaker discusses the benefits of earning extra money and using platforms like Upwork for freelancing. They imply that while greed should not be the motivator, understanding the role of money in determining the quality of life is important. For them, freelancing on Upwork allowed them to accumulate enough capital to buy a house, which could potentially yield passive income in the future.

The speaker also mentions improvement of both technical and non-technical skills through freelancing. In their job at Nordstrom, they work extensively with SQL databases and freelancing allowed them to work with other technologies such as Google BigQuery and AWS Redshift. 

They emphasize how freelancing on platforms like Upwork provides opportunities to develop non-technical skills vital in the workforce, such as stakeholder management, charging clients appropriately, and the ability to market oneself effectively. The speaker discusses the importance of selling oneself and demonstrating skills in the best light possible to meet the needs of potential clients or employers. As a technically skilled person, they have learned the crucial skill of confidently presenting legitimacy and ability. Furthermore, they stress the notion of stepping up to meet challenges, even those initially outside the comfort zone. The speaker appreciates the financial security offered by freelancing platform, Upwork. Through the platform, they generate enough income to cover basic living expenses, alleviating potential financial distress if something were to happen with their traditional 9-to-5 job at Nordstrom. This additional income source offers them greater bargaining power in job negotiations, contributing to overall career and financial freedom. They value the autonomy and security that working outside of a primary job can provide. Further, they plan to discuss their personal reasons for choosing Upwork for freelancing activities. The author has been using Upwork for over a year and finds it more professional than other freelancing networks. The author notes three major reasons for preferring Upwork: higher rates, an option to limit job competition to US-based contractors, and the ability to avoid competing on rates. The author emphasizes the risk of a "dangerous downward spiral" when freelancers compete on rates. While acknowledging that other platforms may also offer similar services, the author strongly recommends Upwork based on personal satisfaction. The author then explores how to succeed on Upwork, suggesting two significant steps: creating a compelling profile and writing outstanding proposals. To secure a job on Upwork, one needs to navigate the site where jobs are posted and apply appropriately. The text gives advice on freelance work on platforms like Upwork. It explains that job budgets posted by clients are negotiable, and freelancers shouldn't be hesitant to ask for more payment. Freelancers send proposals for jobs on the board, which can be accepted or denied. Once accepted, they agree on a rate, complete the job, get paid, and then both the client and freelancer leave reviews. The text also offers tips for making an effective Upwork profile to stand out and gain clients' trust. The four tips are: 1) verify your ID and phone number, 2) indicate any certifications you have in the certification section, 3) use persuasive marketing language, and 4) make yourself stand out from other freelancers. The text discusses strategies for technical professionals, like software engineers or data analysts, to stand out while finding work. The audience tends to be non-technical individuals or business owners who may not understand industry-specific language. The author suggests using specific wording to stand out from the competition and to appear knowledgeable and competent to potential clients. Some methods provided include using your profile effectively to provide vital information like certifications, and special characteristics (the author mentions a "donation clause" as an example). Profiles should be strategically designed to grab attention. For data analysts, the author recommends identifying as 'data scientists' for visibility because the term is more recognized in general lexicon. Lastly, they encourage professionals to ask clients for reviews if they have provided satisfactory service, as this helps build a positive reputation. The text discusses strategies for improving one's profile on the freelancing platform Upwork. A key focus is cultivating good client relationships to obtain positive reviews, as having many high-quality reviews on one's profile is deemed crucial for success on Upwork. The author advises freelancers to dedicate less time searching for jobs and more time working to increase revenues.

He also suggests that freelancers should aim to have a few big clients, eliminating the need to constantly seek new ones. The process of obtaining jobs involves the job being posted on the Upwork site, then candidates submitting proposals. The author identifies five components needed to create an outstanding proposal, though only the first point is detailed here: "skillfully underbid." 

Freelancers are advised to do this for their initial few contracts to obtain two to three five-star reviews with descriptive text, which significantly boosts credibility on the platform. The ultimate goal of underbidding is to secure the contract and obtain a five-star review, a strategy intended for better rates in future jobs. The text provides an inside perspective on using Upwork, a freelance hiring platform. The speaker notes that achieving a top-rated badge and maintaining a high profile rating can result in receiving job offers directly from clients, eliminating the need to apply for jobs. To achieve this, the speaker even accepted a couple of jobs at a loss to gain positive five-star reviews.
Upwork uses a system of 'proposal points' to encourage quality proposals and prevent spamming. Due to his/her high rating, the speaker no longer uses these points as jobs are offered directly. 
In terms of tips, it's advised to figure out a client's name and use it in the proposal as it makes the proposal stand out and appear more personalized. This can often be found in reviews left by previous contractors. The speaker also mentions noticing and appreciating personal details, such as their own name, in comments on their YouTube channel. -The text gives tips on how to make job proposals more effective.
- The objective is to make sure the proposal stands out.
- Applying for jobs with over 10 proposals may be a waste as the first 10 are usually seen.
- One strategy provided is to complete the job ahead of time, this was exemplified with a web scraping job case. The speaker was able to earn $200 in an hour by delivering the job immediately after seeing the post.
- Another tip offered is to write step-by-step processes that will be followed to achieve results. This showcases knowledge and expertise in the field.
- There is also mention about the similar-naming trick to grab attention, but it's not elaborated upon. The speaker is offering advice on how to get web scraping job proposals accepted. The speaker breaks down their own process to increase confidence in their ability to carry out the job. They mention that having a clear plan and including past related experiences are beneficial for convincing clients. The speaker admits their proposals used to get rejected a lot and though there are no surefire ways to secure a proposal, combining all their tips can significantly increase chances of acceptance. The speaker provides an example where they had used their prior experience in real estate data analysis to win a contract from a client requiring similar skills. This client then turned out to be one of their best and easiest to work with. The speaker implies that drawing from personal projects applicable to the client's needs can be an effective strategy, even if it's not always possible. The speaker also hints at future discussion about ensuring one gets good clients. The text mentions Project Pro, a website that provides solved data science, big data, and machine learning projects. These projects are created by industry experts at leading companies like Facebook and Walmart. Project Pro offers a variety of projects for practicing data science and big data skills. These can be used for learning purposes or applied in real-world business or client scenarios. The website features a tool allowing people to select their role and area of interest, and provides a list of relevant projects. All project solutions are verified and solved, offering a curated library of work in data science, machine learning, and big data. Projectpro.io offers solutions, reusable code, guided videos, 24-7 tech support and over 2,000 code recipes for free. Upon joining the service, users also gain access to over 120 solved projects. They also have a YouTube channel for more information. The text shares advice for succeeding on the platform Upwork, suggesting learning a programming language, pointing to Python or R, as that enables users to undertake more diverse tasks, not just those connected to data analysis. Also, knowing programming language can possibly lead to jobs in software engineering or web development, thus expanding potential career horizons. Lastly, an important aspect often overlooked on Upwork is client management. Finishing the job isn't enough; it must also be completed on time to earn five-star reviews. The text is about managing work scope and client expectations in consultancy work, specifically on freelancing platforms like Upwork. The speaker emphasizes the importance of avoiding scope creep, where the amount of required work for a job expands beyond what was originally agreed. To manage this, the speaker has crafted a client dashboard. This dashboard includes key details such as client contact information, the proposal sent, agreed-upon rate, legal documents (like NDAs and SOWs), invoices, and the precise scope of work. Charging a flat rate, especially for beginners, gives clients confidence about the cost of a project. However, he suggests moving towards an hourly fee as one gains more experience. The speaker also advocates for clarity on project's due dates. He shared a link to his dashboard located on Gumroad for reference and consultation. The text provides information on different types of work contracts on Upwork, which are either hourly or project-based. In project-based contracts, the worker receives a flat fee regardless of the time it takes to complete the work. On the other hand, hourly contracts involve the worker getting paid based on the number of hours worked. In the future, the speaker recommends choosing hourly rate projects as they usually prove to be more beneficial. To keep clients assured of the project progress, the speaker suggests using a Kanban board that lists out tasks and their status (not started, in progress, completed). The speaker emphasizes the importance of clear and consistent communication with clients, even when things go wrong, as this builds their confidence and understanding. They also suggest having a project management dashboard to facilitate client communication. Last, the speaker mentions they will be discussing the "three golden rules of consulting" next. 1. One should provide the client with value that surpasses the price they pay. This could involve performing work valued at a higher rate than the remuneration.
2. It's crucial to focus on delivering value for clients or customers constantly. This is more important than merely focusing on making more money, which can lead to greed and potential loss of business value.
3. Longevity in business depends on providing value, rather than charging clients as much as possible.
4. Communication with clients should be thorough, consistent, and accurate. This is beneficial even when issues arise, as it can prevent clients from becoming angry.
5. The idea that the customer is king is disputed. Dissatisfactory clients should be offloaded quickly in favor of better opportunities.
6. The need for experts validates that the customer is not always right.
7. The person speaking has only dealt with two difficult clients in their career, one of whom they could not offload. The speaker had a negative experience with a client, leading to a non-five-star review on his professional profile. He believes he shouldn't have accepted the task initially. The client kept modifying the requirements and had insufficiently planned tight timelines, causing stress and frantic communication. The speaker doesn't appreciate clients who frequently panic and fail to communicate effectively and calmly, and those who regularly question his rates. The speaker suggests professionals should consider whether they are delivering the required value, and if the client can afford to hire a consultant. He believes in competing on quality rather than rates, to avoid overworking and risking burnout due to lower earnings. The speaker emphasizes the importance of managing clients well. The speaker also contemplates what to charge clients, indicating it's a challenging issue to address. The text is from an individual sharing his/her experience of working on Upwork, a freelance platform. The individual charged 30% above his/her salary from regular employment for the freelance work. Calculations show an approximate rate of $66/hour was charged on Upwork, which calculated to $120,000 per year after Upwork deducted its fees. The individual has since made a decision to leave Upwork due to several reasons. He/she has been juggling regular employment during the day and freelancing in the evenings, which has taken a toll on mental and physical health. His/her reasons for leaving Upwork include a lack of ownership over the work created on the platform, despite building technical skills and getting paid for it. The individual states that even though it was a fair exchange, it did not significantly contribute to wealth building. The person speaking worked on an hourly basis and felt a lack of wealth and ownership in their work. Now, they feel happier with their YouTube channel as they feel more ownership even though they acknowledge YouTube's overall control. They advise tech workers, or analytics professionals, to consider the opportunity cost of spending their time on consulting on the side, suggesting that chasing promotions may be a more beneficial investment especially once a good paying job at a major company is secured. The speaker used their experience at Nordstrom and Upwork to highlight how focusing on job promotions could have potentially brought more income than doing consulting work. They hint at quitting consulting due to these reflective thoughts. The channel owner is generating substantial income thanks to the support from viewers, potentially surpassing earnings on Upwork.
