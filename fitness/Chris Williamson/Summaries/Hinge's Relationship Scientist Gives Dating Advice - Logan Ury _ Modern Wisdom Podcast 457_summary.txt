Logan Yuri is the director of relationship science at Hinge, a position she'd been hoping to land for over a decade. Her job involves carrying out research into various aspects of dating, using both her personal experiences and observations from her coaching clients. She reported hearing a lot about women dating men with lower sex drives, often tied to depression, which sparked her interest in researching how to support such a partner and handle these issues. She also mentioned how people have turned into "maximizers", always interested in researching options and alternatives extensively, whether it's choosing a restaurant, hotel, or a dating partner. Mental health has become a very important topic in the dating scene, based on research conducted around the end of 2021. 86% of the surveyed people stated that it was important for them to date someone who is in therapy and prioritizes mental health. There was also a trend in people being more inclined to go on a second date with someone if they mentioned on the first date that they attend therapy. This data was gathered through a joint effort involving research collaborators and data scientists, with the narration by a person who had prior experience working with data science. Other trends discovered over the years involve men with low libido, the challenges it poses in relationships, and the issues men face with mental health and depression. It's important to note that these trends are not solely gendered and have a broad impact. The text discusses the mental health issues prevalent in society, the impact of digital culture on dating, and the dependence of Gen Z on friends for advice. The writer expresses concern that the digital age has turned elements of dating into a crowdsourced activity, where people frequently consult their friends before making decisions. The writer calls on Gen Z to rely less on advice from friends and instead build their emotional intelligence to make more personal decisions, especially in dating, Rather, our friends should be cheerleaders supporting us, but not setting our goals. The text discusses changes in social behavior over the years, with a focus on how technology and social media have greatly reduced people's privacy. 15 years ago, events called carnage were held, which involved various playful activities. These events have stopped occurring due to concerns about irresponsible behavior being captured and circulated on social media, given that everyone carries a camera in their pocket. This surveillance culture has led individuals to feel more monitored and less at ease in social situations. Furthermore, the introduction of dating apps in college has changed the nature of dating, potentially exposing students to a wider pool of potential partners. The text refers to the impact of technological developments on university social life, including dating apps and social media. There's a discussion about how dating apps not only broaden the pool of potential partners but also increase competition as students have more options beyond their own university's community. The text also addresses the effect of ever-present cameras and possible surveillance on individual behavior. The author shares her experience of cognitive overload when she had to constantly check her behavior due to its potential recording by a New York Times reporter. This can also apply to students who feel they must act in a certain way because they could be recorded or have their actions shared online, leading to a possible change in their psychology and causing exhaustion. The speaker is discussing dating trends among millennials and Gen Z. They are a millennial dating expert who has spent substantial time researching this generation, primarily through platforms like Hinge. They see a need to better understand Gen Z dating trends as that group ages into the dating market. They noted that dating is becoming more fluid, with less focus on finding "the one" and getting married for life. This can include trends like non-monogamy or different forms of relationships. They also mention the show Euphoria as a (potentially unrealistic) view of the Gen Z high school experience, which includes dealing with drug addiction and overstimulation. The text discusses cultural changes impacting dating, particularly among Gen Z. Less emphasis is being put on marriage and having kids in this generation, partially due to concerns such as climate change. However, the desire to love and be loved continues to play a significant role in people's lives. The author acknowledges difficulties in understanding newer concepts, like gender fluidity and non-monogamy, which are becoming increasingly mainstream. They express feeling out of touch, noting how each successive generation can make the older ones feel disconnected with societal changes. Millennials are reportedly changing many dimensions, including the way we use dining room furniture and paper napkins. There's a shift of focus from millennials to Gen Z. The text also mentions Bo Burnham's work "Inside" that touches on aging and aging out from being perceived as the young, innovative demographic. A 34-year-old individual reflects on how his performance and recovery in workout sessions were improving till his early 30s, but he anticipates that these physical activities will become harder as he ages. The text discusses the idea of physical appearance and aging. The speaker suggests that as individuals reach their 30s, value should shift from physical appearance to personal qualities such as wisdom, empathy, and confidence. This change in focus reportedly occurred for the speaker around the ages of 31 or 32, perhaps hastened by the effects of lockdown during the pandemic. The speaker also mentions experiencing bodily changes, such as the difficulty in overcoming hangovers as they aged. The speaker's husband is mentioned as someone focused on health and longevity through methods like intermittent fasting. The text ends with the observation that people now live longer than before, which impacts our perspectives on age and health. The discussion involves considerations around long-term commitments in human relationships such as marriage. This becomes more significant considering increased life expectancy in modern societies. The conversation specifically mentions the example of a 22-year-old Mormon who is already married, suggesting a commitment for potentially 70 years of marriage, plus eternity from a religious perspective. There is also a discussion about dating, and the idea of designing a lifestyle around dating. The person speaking seems to advocate an intentional approach to relationships, as indicated by a reference to the line "intentionally ever after" from their book.
 The text describes the philosophy behind applying self-help principles to dating and love. The speaker believes that while love is natural, dating has to be learned, particularly due to evolving societal norms and the relatively new phenomena of online dating. The speaker suggests that historically people didn't choose their own partners, which only started to happen around 1890. Online dating began around 1994-1995 with Match Group and Kiss.com, and dating apps were introduced a decade ago. The speaker suggests that the challenge of choosing from thousands of potential options is a new and difficult challenge that humans are not evolutionarily designed to handle. The text discusses the evolution of marriage from an economic institution to an emotional relationship based on self-actualization and love. It argues that the reluctance to analyze romantic relationships using scientific methods stems from the perception that love is a mysterious or "magical" realm, which should not be quantified. The text insinuates that insights from relationship science and behavioral science can play a role in making informed decisions about choosing a life partner.

The text also introduces the term 'conceptual inertia', which is the delay in cultural responses to scientific discoveries or ideas. It uses the historical instance of how society came to terms with the earth revolving around the sun as an example of conceptual inertia. The author believes that applying scientific research to relationships may be a new concept that society needs time to adapt to. The text discusses the tension between cultural perception of relationships, often idealized and romanticized in media such as movies, and the reality of relationships as presented by relationship science. The author mentions the concept of "cultural inertia" which suggests that societal belief systems are slow to incorporate new scientific insights or change perceptions. The author also comments on a similar issue related to the perception of climate change. She expresses her personal definition of romance as a deep and enduring friendship and partnership with one's spouse, challenging the superficial notions of romance often propagated by popular culture. The text highlights the speaker's view on romance as something much more profound than courtship rituals or fleeting romantic gestures. According to the author, true romance is reflected in long-term commitment, support, and deep connection in the face of adversity. This perspective was shaped by the speaker's experience with their husband who was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer. The speaker understands romance as being there for your partner beyond the health or physical condition, in everyday practicalities, and in commitment to building a life together. Outlining this view is part of their mission to help people find long-term partners and establish durable relationships, suggesting the importance of a meaningful and supportive partnership over the fantasy promoted in pop culture. The text discusses the idea of personal accountability in dating and finding a partner, emphasizing that many people may view their lack of success in love as a personal failure. It contrasts modern dating with past practices, where marriages were often arranged and personal choices were limited. The author is suggesting that the freedom to make our own choices in love is both liberating and frightening as it comes with the responsibility of success or failure. The text ends with the question on how individuals can be satisfied with their choices despite possible negative outcomes. The speaker also mentioned a chapter in their book that discusses why dating is currently harder than ever. The text discusses the approach to make better decisions in relationships. It encourages understanding past behavior through an activity called "relationship audit" where people review past relationships and analyze patterns. This helps to understand personal behavior in relationships and make different choices in the future. Important factors for long-term relationship success are loyalty, kindness, emotional stability, and the ability to argue well. Factors like looks, money, having the same personality or interests are less important as people get used to them over time. The text advocates an intentional and mindful approach to love. The speaker suggests that important factors in a partner aren't their external or status markers, such as looks, money or career, but rather how one's partner makes them feel and which side of oneself they bring out. The modern dating market is reportedly increasingly asymmetric, with more highly educated, successful women and less equally accomplished men, which can create dating challenges. The speaker also argues against the common preference for taller men in dating, suggesting the height filter on dating apps may actually limit one's options and prevent them from meeting potentially wonderful partners. The text states that only 14% of the American male population is six feet or taller and only 3.9% are 6'3 or taller. However, height does not impact long-term relationship success. The author suggests dating the least attractive person you're attracted to, to avoid undue influence by others' opinions and possibly find a "hidden gem". Barry Schwartz's research differentiates between maximizing and satisficing decision-making. Maximizing involves thorough research to find the perfect solution, while satisficing sets a high standard but stops once this is met. The text discusses two types of people with different decision-making processes: maximizers and satisficers. Maximizers are individuals who conduct rigorous research to get the 'best' result and are not easily satisfied because they believe there may always be something better. Satisficers, by contrast, are content with 'good enough' options and can feel happy about their choices. This dichotomy is explored in the context of modern dating, where maximizers are continually swiping in search of the perfect match, while satisficers are willing to commit to someone who meets their key requirements. The author suggests this leads to discontent among maximizers, who struggle to commit even to a great partner due to the perceived possibility of finding a better match. The text identifies three types of dating tendencies: the "romanticizer", the "maximizer", and the "hesitator". The romanticizer has unrealistic relationship expectations, believing in an idea of a perfect soulmate and that relationships should always be easy. The maximizer has unrealistic expectations of their partner, believing they will find the perfect individual rather than investing in the relationship. The hesitator has unrealistic expectations of themselves, thinking they are not yet ready or lovable enough to date. This category has grown during the pandemic. The text suggests that these tendencies are based on unrealistic expectations and that successful relationships require effort and investment. To improve at dating, one needs to actually date and experience different relationships to understand what works. The author advises against obsessing over idealized "meet cute" situations or the concept of a soulmate, as these can distract from what truly matters in a relationship. The day of meeting is insignificant compared to the overall duration of a relationship. The theory of the secretary problem is mentioned as an example of the concept of satisficement rather than maximization, which posits that after experiencing a third of possible options, one should settle on the next satisfactory choice. The text discusses strategies on how to approach dating. Two types of people are identified: "maximizers" and "hesitators". Maximizers are advised to stop spending excessive time on research, find a great partner, and build a relationship with them. Hesitators are encouraged to stop procrastinating, start dating, and even set a deadline to motivate themselves. The text also mentions that finding appropriate outfits for dates and building comfort with the dating process can help hesitators get over their fear or discomfort. The text suggests solutions for people who have gained weight during the pandemic or who might be anxious due to long periods of not dating. Finally, it notes there may be a correlation between these behaviors and attachment styles, with maximizers sometimes exhibiting avoidant attachment behavior. The text suggests that people who romanticize relationships are typically anxiously attached, and often have a rom-com style vision of love. The speaker mentions that they teach a class in which they discuss dating tendencies and attachment styles. The speaker works at Hinge, where they advise clients on how to create effective dating profiles. It's important to tell a story through the profile and highlight the top three things the user wants to communicate. The profile should have variety, including diverse photos and ensuring important points are made without being repetitive. The text provides advice for setting up a successful online dating profile. Specifically, it suggests having a clear photo of one's face, a full-body shot, an activity photo, and at least one photo with friends or family — all without obscuring sunglasses, filters, or making it difficult to identify oneself. It's also recommended to use prompt responses to genuinely communicate personality and preferences rather than resorting to cliches. Being intentional about this could lead to beneficial conversations. Mirror selfies, gym selfies, and photographs showing smoking are generally discouraged. The text offers advice for online dating. High quality photos that accurately represent your personality are more impactful than poorly lit selfies. The approach to online dating should depend on personal habits and tendencies. Some people are too picky and limit their possibilities excessively through strict filters. The advice for them is to be more open and flexible, especially in the early stages of online dating. They should consider adjusting their parameters such as distance, age, and height. On the other hand, there are those who are not selective enough, leading them to lots of uninteresting dates. For them, they should have higher standards on who they choose to go out with. The crucial information is that a good conversation should involve both parties taking turns to talk. Asking follow-up questions can portray a higher level of interest in the other person. Research indicates that individuals who ask more questions and spend less time talking during conversations are perceived to be better conversationalists. This is because people typically enjoy discussing themselves and feeling valued or interesting. Therefore, in dating, it's more important to show interest in the other person than to be the interesting one yourself.
For those who feel their life lacks interesting aspects for discussion, it is suggested to ask deep questions, flirt, behave vulnerably, show curiosity, and use a support response, which delves deeper into what's happening for the other person instead of shifting attention back to oneself. The text discusses the importance of good interaction and reciprocity when it comes to dating and conversations, highlighting the common mistake of one-sided question-asking that may feel like an interrogation. The speaker also addresses the trope of "the spark" in romantic relationships, arguing that they believe it is overemphasized and could be problematic in modern dating. The speaker suggests that expecting instant chemistry or love at first sight (which only 11% of people experience according to research) may be unrealistic. Instead, the speaker alludes to the "mere exposure effect," which posits that we often develop feelings or attraction over time as we get to know someone better. The text discusses the concept of "the spark" in relationships, saying that attraction can grow over time rather than being instantaneous. Some individuals may appear more attractive due to their charisma or attractiveness, which may be linked to narcissism. The presence of "the spark" does not guarantee a long-term connection, as illustrated by the many divorced or unhappily married couples who initially experienced it. The author advocates for the "slow burn" strategy, where attraction builds over time as you get to know someone. The text also discusses the potential influence of cultural focus on the concept of "the spark" and the misunderstanding that immediate excitement equates to long-term potential in a relationship. Rom-com movies often perpetuate the idea of the "spark" in romantic relationships and the narrative of "they lived happily ever after," focusing mainly on the early stages of a relationship. However, they do not depict the real trials and tribulations that couples may experience in the long term, such as issues that come up years into a marriage or with children. The concept of the "spark" could also refer to an individual's charisma or attractiveness, which can draw people to them in social settings. Bill Clinton's style of making one feel like they're the only person in the room is noted as an example of this kind of "spark". The key points of the text are:

1. The sensation of feeling a 'spark' with someone doesn't necessarily indicate a particular relationship dynamic with that person, it might be just representative of the individual's charisma or vibrant energy.
2. Admiring your partner in a relationship can add to the pull of attraction.
3. It is important to distinguish if a person's attractive personality is due to their individual character or influenced by their interaction with you in specific.
4. The concept of the 'Halo Effect' is presented, which is the tendency to ascribe positive traits to good-looking people.
5. Along with physical attraction, admiring your partner's virtues/traits should also be considered important in a relationship.
 The text discusses the concept of 'sliding versus deciding' in relationships. 'Sliding' refers to moving from one stage of a relationship to another without clear discussions about what these stages signify. 'Deciding' involves explicit discussions about the implications of every step in the relationship. Research shows that couples who choose the 'deciding' approach tend to have healthier relationships, more passion, better sex, and a higher chance of staying together in the long run. In other words, certain milestones in a relationship should be made intentionally (deciding) rather than spontaneously (sliding). Also, the text suggests that admiration should be based on learning and passion instead of popularity or societal approval. The text discusses the importance of intentionality in life, particularly in terms of romantic relationships. However, the author also acknowledges that becoming too hyper-focused on controlling every aspect of a relationship can rob it of spontaneity and natural growth. Examples of healthy intentionality in dating include attending therapy to handle personal issues from the past, understanding personal preferences, being open-minded during dates, and having open conversations with potential partners about expectations and plans. It's important to balance strategic life decisions with an ability to adapt and evolve naturally. This text discusses ways to navigate a relationship, including being spontaneous and not missing key moments. It also talks about how to decide if a relationship is worth staying in or not. This can depend on understanding your tendencies in relationships: staying too long (hitcher), or leaving quickly (ditcher). It also suggests evaluating what you are contributing to the relationship, whether you express your feelings openly, and whether external factors are temporarily affecting it. A useful method is referred to as "the wardrobe test" where your partner is compared to a piece of clothing in your closet to reveal your feelings about the relationship. The text discusses two types of people in relationships - hitchers who tend to stick with their relationships even when they might not be working out anymore, and ditchers who tend to leave relationships. The text suggests that how a person feels can sometimes indicate whether they have outgrown a relationship or if something isn't right. Lists of pros and cons can also be useful but the 'wardrobe test question' could be a good way to get in touch with one's feelings about a relationship. Those who identify as 'hitchers' may benefit from understanding the concept of 'sunk cost fallacy', which is the idea that a previous decision or investment does not necessarily mean that one should continue on the same path. The analogy presented is spending $20 on a concert ticket but then deciding not to attend the concert - the money is already spent and attending the concert won't impact that fact. In the context of relationships, this means one doesn't have to stay in a relationship simply because they've invested time into it. The text discusses the difference between falling in love and being in love. During the initial stages of falling in love, the brain gets stimulated similar to using stimulatory drugs like cocaine. However, this doesn't last forever and transitions into the state of being in love. Long term relationships, marriage, or parenthood involve accepting this transition. There may be changes in the intensity of feelings but it doesn't lessen the beauty of having a partner who shares life's ups and downs. The process encourages adjusting expectations from the constant honeymoon phase to a more enduring love stage. It's also highlighted that change in people and relationships are possible, and it's essential particularly for those exhibiting avoidant attachment styles. The text discusses two attraction systems in relationships: passionate and the companionate system. The passionate system is characterized by intense emotions and physical attraction while the companionate system is more of deep friendship and love. The text also discusses how the initial passionate attraction usually fades over time, and this is a normal part of relationships. However, if a person determines that their relationship is not beneficial for them, they should consider getting out of it. The process of breaking up should be well-planned, similar to setting a goal, which involves setting a deadline, preparing what to say, and planning post-breakup interactions. It's also advised to avoid sex after a breakup as it could create confusion. Overcoming heartbreak of a romantic relationship can be compared to withdrawal from a drug; it can be physically painful and there's evidence that it can negatively impact cognitive functions and provoke negative behaviors. To navigate through a breakup, try activities that help rediscover yourself. These activities involve doing things that you couldn't pursue during the relationship. Examples include going to the beach if your partner didn't like it or going to jazz shows if your partner wasn't a fan of it. Research suggests that doing these activities can help individuals move forward faster and feel happier after breakups. It's also useful to do lots of journaling, such as making lists of the negative aspects of the person or the relationship. This can help process the breakup. It's important to allow yourself some time to heal because navigating a breakup can be challenging. The text discusses the concept that not just time, but finding meaning in past experiences, can heal wounds.
