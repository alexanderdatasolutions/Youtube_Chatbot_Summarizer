The text discusses the principles of strength training. Strength is defined as the ability to generate force and can be measured in various ways, including by tracking the speed of the bar in lifts. Instead of striving for maximal lifts, the speaker focuses on maintaining a certain number of reps in reserve (0 to 2 reps left in the tank), which essentially means not training to the point of full exhaustion. Although occasionally training to failure does occur, it is not the main approach due to the risk of injury or improper form. It is noted that letting go of ego lifting can be a significant challenge. The individual describes their workout routine, which includes four days of weightlifting a week. The routine includes two days dedicated to upper body lifting and two days dedicated to lower body lifting. They prefer to prioritize big lifts and work in high-repetition volumes, usually between 18 to 24 working sets per session. They sometimes adjust their training volume depending on their condition, especially if they have had poor sleep. Some specific exercises include floor presses, pull downs, incline presses, rows, incline curls, overhead tricep extensions and preacher curls. They also do stability training on off days, dedicating a full hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and spend a minimum of 20 minutes on other days. The text describes a metaphor related to balance training. The speaker compares this yet not fully grasped training style to the difference between a high horsepower streetcar and a lower horsepower track car. Despite the streetcar's raw power, the specifically designed and balanced track car would outperform it on a race track. Similarly, the speaker implies the importance of balance training in a holistic approach to physical fitness. Conveying it might be more challenging to implement, yet contributes significantly to effective workout routines. The text also mentions a book the speaker had written, suggesting a more comprehensive discussion on balance training and its integration into workouts. The text describes the differences between a stock 165 horsepower car, and a M3 car. The stock car is relatively lighter weighing 2,400 pounds compared to M3's 3,400 pounds. Although the M3 is faster on straight paths the stock car had a 2-second faster lap time due to its cornering speed. This speed difference, despite M3's powerful engine, is explained by the power loss from the car to the road. In terms of physics, the text emphasises that friction and power transmission from the engine's crankshaft to the tires, and from the tires to the road are key. Allowing this power flow without interruption is essential hence, the chassis and suspension of the car should be firm. This analogy is further extended to explain the vitality of preventing energy leaks to avoid injuries in the human body. The narrative concludes with the assertion that stability is an essential aspect to consider in car racing, and it was learned through personal experience. The speaker had continuous back pain and discomfort in his SI joint and right elbow, despite maintaining good form during pull-ups and other exercises. He consulted with Michael Stromsnes, a practitioner of DNS (Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization), who evaluated his form and identified a lack of control and stability in his scapula as the root cause of his issues. The speaker then began working with experts, including Beth Lewis and Kyler Brown, to rebuild his movement and align his body. This involved a year without doing pull-ups or deadlifts to correct his form and posture. The speaker started this process in 2017 and continues to work on DNS methods several times a week. DNS (Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization) is a type of training based on the idea that humans naturally had perfect movement patterns until about two years old. Hardwired genetic movement sequences, as observed in children, are targeted for improvement. Some adults have corrupted these optimal patterns. The goal of DNS training is to "update" these poorer movement behaviors. It's recommended to start DNS training with a practitioner due to its complexity. However, it's noted that DNS can be practiced independently once understood. Benefits can extend to various other activities and common issues, such as flexible ankles in swimmers. Several DNS practitioners are available across the country. The speaker is discussing their efforts to improve their dorsiflexion and alleviate discomfort when doing step-ups in exercise. They work with a trainer named Kyler on strengthening their soleus muscle, a muscle in the calf, to counteract the forward movement of the knee over the toes during this exercise. The speaker also shares they learned much about this from their personal rehabilitation experience after snapping their Achilles tendon. They overshot the strengthening on their right leg, leading to an imbalance that needed adjustment. Their surgery was conducted by one of the top surgeons in the UK, outfitted through the NHS, but had a 13-day wait period before the procedure could be performed. In the context of exercise and muscle development, especially in regard to the lower body and glute muscles, step-ups or step-up variations appear to recruit a high amount of muscle fiber and thus may increase lower body power. This information was shared on Instagram by Dr. Eddie Joe, PhD, who ranked glute exercises by the amount of muscle fiber recruitment. The Instagram post referenced a study which found step-ups to be a top exercise for glute and lower body strength. The text refers to an instructional video where the speaker and a person named Beth demonstrate how to perform a step-up exercise. The video covers different variants of the step-up exercise including weighted, unweighted, low box, high box, exercises focusing on eccentric and concentric movements, as well as how to avoid common mistakes. It also explains how to correctly unload the ribs when performing the exercise. This video was suggested for people to watch if they found the information useful.
