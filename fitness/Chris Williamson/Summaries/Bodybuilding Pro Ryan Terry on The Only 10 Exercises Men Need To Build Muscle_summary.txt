In both maintaining and increasing muscle size, compound lifts including deadlifts, bench press, squats, and hanging leg raise for core are recommended. These exercises target multiple muscle groups. The hanging leg raise is deemed highly effective for midsection workouts, including the transverse abdominis and both upper and lower abdominals. A common mistake people make when doing hanging leg raises is creating momentum and swinging, which causes them to engage the hip flexors instead of the midsection. The correct technique is to tuck the hips in and ensure the upper and lower abdominals are being contracted before initiating the move. The speaker emphasizes the importance of the mind to muscle connection in effective workout. He talks about his experience performing hanging leg raises, and points out that one should just go up to 90 degrees to isolate the midsection. He does not believe in training the midsection after every session and instead suggests giving it two full one-hour sessions with three to four days rest between, in a six to eight rep range. However, he mentions that this approach led to somewhat distended, blocky abs and back problems, including slipped discs. He also confesses that he learned about the significance of training properly rather than aiming for heavy weights from his muscle development over the years. The speaker discussed their workout involving mainly body weight exercises to compensate for exerted anterior strength. They gave a list of exercises useful for isolating and developing certain muscle groups: squats, bench press, deadlift, hanging leg raises, incline dumbbell chest, dumbbell shoulder press, and lying hamstring curl. They emphasized that the choice of exercise largely depends on personal preference and what one feels works best for them. They further emphasized the importance of nutrition and understanding your own body when crafting a workout routine and diet plan. The text refers to a discussion about different types of exercises, including squat, bench, deadlift, hanging leg raise, incline chest press with dumbbells, shoulder press, seated calf raise, overhead tricep extension rope and close grip pull-ups. For overhead tricep extension rope, it is recommended to avoid going too heavy too soon and to ensure the elbows and shoulder stay in a fixed position. Overextending slightly is advisable for a full stretch and contraction. As for bicep exercises, close grip pull-ups are recommended as they also work out the back. Despite being a physique competitor, the speaker incorporates deadlifts into their workout, although they now focus on more isolation and hyperextensions. The person is discussing their workout routine which includes deadlifts for overall muscle workout and a method called iso-tension for muscle control and condition, particularly for midsection training. They explain iso-tension as the process of fully breathing in, exhaling all the air out, then crunching abs as hard as possible for three seconds, which can be done for any muscle part. The routine is repeated for five rounds and, despite its monotonous nature, results in a tight and conditioned body. They also suggest this method can be combined with other exercises like bicep curls, holding and squeezing the muscles as hard as possible between working sets. The speaker, assumed to be a professional bodybuilder named Ryan, suggests that failures in muscle control, such as uncontrolled bicep shaking, is commonly due to lack of isolated muscle exercises (ISO holds) and insufficient practice with poses. Ryan claims that to excel in bodybuilding, besides regular workouts and diet, extensive posing practice is crucial. Starting from 8 weeks before a show, he incorporates ISO holds with every pose and every muscle group into his 30-minute post-cardio workout. He emphasizes that successful bodybuilding requires significant attention to details often overlooked, such as presentation and discipline in diet.
